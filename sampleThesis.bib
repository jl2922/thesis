Abstract = {{We provide a pedagogical introduction to the two main variants of real-space quantum Monte
Carlo methods for electronic-structure calculations: variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and dif-
fusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Assuming no prior knowledge on the subject, we review in depth
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used in VMC for sampling the square of an approximate
wave function, discussing details important for applications to electronic systems. We also re-
view in detail the more sophisticated DMC algorithm within the fixed-node approximation,
introduced to avoid the infamous Fermionic sign problem, which allows one to sample a more
accurate approximation to the ground-state wave function. Throughout this review, we discuss
the statistical methods used for evaluating expectation values and statistical uncertainties. In
particular, we show how to estimate nonlinear functions of expectation values and their statis-
tical uncertainties.}},

abstract = {We present two efficient and intruder-free methods for treating dynamic correlation on top of general multi-configuration reference wave functions---including such as obtained by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) with large active spaces. The new methods are the second order variant of the recently proposed multi-reference linearized coupled cluster method (MRLCC) [S. Sharma, A. Alavi, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 102815 (2015)], and of N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), with expected accuracies similar to MRCI+Q and (at least) CASPT2, respectively. Great efficiency gains are realized by representing the first-order wave function with a combination of internal contraction (IC) and matrix product state perturbation theory (MPSPT). With this combination, only third order reduced density matrices (RDMs) are required. Thus, we obviate the need for calculating (or estimating) RDMs of fourth or higher order; these had so far posed a severe bottleneck for dynamic correlation treatments involving the large active spaces accessible to DMRG. Using several benchmark systems, including first and second row containing small molecules, Cr{\$}{\_}2{\$}, pentacene and oxo-Mn(Salen), we shown that active spaces containing at least 30 orbitals can be treated using this method. On a single node, MRLCC2 and NEVPT2 calculations can be performed with over 550 and 1100 virtual orbitals, respectively. We also critically examine the errors incurred due to the three sources of errors introduced in the present implementation - calculating second order instead of third order energy corrections, use of internal contraction and approximations made in the reference wavefunction due to DMRG.},

@article{BenBesHoyMay-JCP-11,
abstract = {A selected multireference configuration interaction (CI) method and the corresponding code are presented. It is based on a procedure of localization that permits to obtain well localized occupied and virtual orbitals. Due to the local character of the electron correlation, using local orbitals allows one to neglect long range interactions. In a first step, three topological matrices are constructed, which determine whether two orbitals must be considered as interacting or not. Two of them concern the truncation of the determinant basis, one for occupied/virtual, the second one for dispersive interactions. The third one concerns the truncation of the list of two electron integrals. This approach permits a fine analysis of each kind of approximation and induces a huge reduction of the CI size and of the computational time. The procedure is tested on linear polyene aldehyde chains, dissociation potential energy curve, and reaction energy of a pesticide-Ca(2+) complex and finally on transition energies of a large iron system presenting a light-induced excited spin-state trapping effect.},

abstract = {Catalase mimics can be used as therapeutic agents against oxidative stress in treatment of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, heart disease, aging, and cancer. (Salen)Mn(III) compounds have been proven to be promising as synthetic antioxidants that, in particular, dismutate H2O2, resulting in two water molecules and oxygen. An understanding of the mechanism of the dismutation process is an important basis for rational design and tuning these analogues to yield better therapeutic properties. In addition, the study of the catalytic mechanism of the functional biomimetics of enzymes might contribute to a better understanding of the complex enzymatic activities for the corresponding biological compounds. For the first time, using the density functional theory method, we have performed a quantum chemical investigation of the catalase activity of the (salen)Mn(III) compound. The real compound reacting with a peroxide molecule has been utilized in the calculations to avoid uncertainties connected with using incomplete models. The reaction has been studied on three different spin potential energy surfaces:  the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The same H2O2 dismutation process has been also calculated with participation of an additional water molecule to check the possible explicit involvement of the solvent molecules in the proton-transfer process in the course of the reaction. Our findings suggest that the first part of the dismutation reactionthe metal oxidation by a peroxide moleculeis a one-step process. The concerted breaking of the O−O peroxide bond, oxidation of the Mn, and a water molecule formation occur on the triplet state potential energy surface. This process can be done effectively at the Mn catalytic center with only 3.6 kcal/mol of activation energy needed. No energetic advantages were found for the assisted proton-transfer mechanism with participation of an ancillary water molecule. Although the singlet state is not accessible on the reactant and TS parts of the reaction potential surface, it becomes the ground state in the vicinity of the final geometry and can play an important role in the second part of the dismutation process.

For the first time, using the density functional theory method, we have performed a quantum chemical investigation of the catalase activity of the (salen)Mn(III) compound. The real compound reacting with a peroxide molecule has been utilized in the calculations to avoid uncertainties connected with using incomplete models. The reaction has been studied on three different spin potential energy surfaces:  the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The same H2O2 dismutation process has been also calculated with participation of an additional water molecule to check the possible explicit involvement of the solvent molecules in the proton-transfer process in the course of the reaction. Our findings suggest that the first part of the dismutation reactionthe metal oxidation by a peroxide moleculeis a one-step process. The concerted breaking of the O−O peroxide bond, oxidation of the Mn, and a water molecule formation occur on the triplet state potential energy surface. This process can be done effectively at the Mn catalytic center with only 3.6 kcal/mol of activation energy needed. No energetic advantages were found for the assisted proton-transfer mechanism with participation of an ancillary water molecule. Although the singlet state is not accessible on the reactant and TS parts of the reaction potential surface, it becomes the ground state in the vicinity of the final geometry and can play an important role in the second part of the dismutation process.},

abstract = {The (salen)Mn(III)-catalyzed epoxidation reaction mechanism has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). There is considerable interest in and controversy over the mechanism of this reaction. The results of experimental studies have offered some support for three different reaction mechanisms:  concerted, stepwise radical, and metallooxetane mediated. In this paper, a theoretical examination of the reaction suggests a novel mechanism that describes the reaction as a multichannel process combining both concerted and stepwise radical pathways. The competing channels have different spin states:  the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The singlet reaction pathway corresponds to a concerted mechanism and leads exclusively to a cis epoxide product. In contrast, the triplet and quintet reactions follow a stepwise mechanism and lead to a product mixture of cis and trans epoxides. We show that the experimentally observed dependence of isomer product ratios on electronic effects connected with the substitution of the catalyst ligands is due to changing the relative position and, hence, the relative activities of the channels with different cis−trans yields. Because the results and conclusions of the present work dramatically differ from the results and conclusion of the recent DFT theoretical investigation (Linde, C.; Akermark, B; Norrby, P.-O.; Svensson, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 5083.), we studied possible sources for the deep contradictions between the two works. The choice of the DFT functional and a model has been shown to be crucial for accurate results. Using high level ab initio calculations (coupled cluster-CCSD(T)), we show that the computational procedure employed in this study generates significantly more reliable numerical results. It is also shown that the smaller cationic model without a chlorine ligand that was used by Linde et al. is too oversimplified with respect to our larger neutral model. For this reason, using the cationic model led to a qualitatively wrong quintet reaction profile that played a key role in theoretical postulates in the earlier work.

Separate sets are developed for the description of valence (3d4s) electron correlation (cc-pVnZ and cc-pVnZ-DK; n = T,Q, 5) and valence plus outer-core (3s3p3d4s) correlation (cc-pwCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ-DK; n = T,Q, 5), as well as these sets augmented by additional diffuse functions for the description of negative ions and weak interactions (aug-cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ-DK). Extensive benchmark calculations at the coupled cluster level of theory are presented for atomic excitation energies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities, as well as molecular calculations on selected hydrides (TiH, MnH, CuH) and other diatomics (TiF, Cu2).

abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

abstract = {A configuration selection method for CI calculations is discussed and applied in which the energy lowering produced in a secular equation by the addition of a given test species to a series of dominant configurations is used as an ordering parameter. Configurations with energy lowerings below a given energy cut-off value are not included in the final secular equations but instead a method of estimating the combined effect of the neglected species on the corresponding non-selected CI results is developed. The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to aseries of dominant configurations in a given state are included.},

abstract = {Current descriptions of the ab initio DMRG algorithm use two superficially different languages: an older language of the renormalization group and renormalized operators, and a more recent language of matrix product states and matrix product operators. The same algorithm can appear dramatically different when written in the two different vocabularies. In this work, we carefully describe the translation between the two languages in several contexts. First, we describe how to efficiently implement the ab-initio DMRG sweep using a matrix product operator based code, and the equivalence to the original renormalized operator implementation. Next we describe how to implement the general matrix product operator/matrix product state algebra within a pure renormalized operator-based DMRG code. Finally, we discuss two improvements of the ab initio DMRG sweep algorithm motivated by matrix product operator language: Hamiltonian compression, and a sum over operators representation that allows for perfect computational parallelism. The connections and correspondences described here serve to link the future developments with the past, and are important in the efficient implementation of continuing advances in ab initio DMRG and related algorithms.},

abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N(2) molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10(15) with very modest computational resources.},

Appl. 17, 401 (1996)], we have implemented harmonic Davidson and state-averaged harmonic Davidson algorithms within the context of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We have assessed their accuracy and stability of convergence in complete-active-space DMRG calculations on the low-lying excited states in the acenes ranging from naphthalene to pentacene. We find that both algorithms offer increased accuracy over the traditional state-averaged Davidson approach, and, in particular, the state-averaged harmonic Davidson algorithm offers an optimal combination of accuracy and stability in convergence.},

The optimization is achieved by means of a genetic algorithm. Taking a one-term-at-a-time strategy as reference our factorization yields speedups of up to 4 (for intermediate excitation levels, smaller basis sets). We derive a theoretical lower bound for the highest order scaling cost and show that it is met by our implementation.

abstract = {Simple closed-form expressions are derived for the "same vacuum" renormalization terms that arise in state-specific multireference coupled cluster (MRCC) theories. Explicit equations are provided for these coupling terms through the triple excitation level of MRCC theory, and a general expression is included for arbitrary-order excitations. The first production-level code (PSIMRCC) for state-specific and rigorously size-extensive Mukherjee multireference coupled cluster singles and doubles (MkCCSD) computations has been written. This code is also capable of evaluating analogous Brillouin-Wigner multireference energies (BWCCSD), including a posteriori size-extensivity corrections. Using correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ, X=D,T,Q), MkCCSD and BWCCSD were tested and compared on two classic multireference problems: (1) the dissociation potential curve of molecular fluorine (F(2)) and (2) the structure and vibrational frequencies of ozone. Comparison with experimental data shows that the Mukherjee method is generally superior to the Brillouin-Wigner theory in predicting energies, structures, and vibrational frequencies. Particularly accurate results for F(2) are obtained by applying the MkCCSD method with localized molecular orbitals. Although the MkCCSD theory greatly improves upon single-reference CCSD for the geometric parameters and a(1) vibrational frequencies of ozone, the antisymmetric stretching frequency omega(3)(b(2)) remains pathological and cannot be properly treated without the inclusion of connected triple excitations. Finally, preliminary multireference MkCCSD results are reported for the singlet-triplet splittings in ortho-, meta-, and para-benzyne, coming within 1.5 kcal mol(-1) of experiment in all cases.},

abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) approach is formulated using a new wave function ansatz based on a sequential transformation of the reference function (sqic-MRCC). This alternative wave function simplifies the formulation of computationally viable methods while preserving the accuracy of the ic-MRCC approach. The structure of the sqic-MRCC wave function allows folding the effect of the single excitations into a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian whose particle rank is equal to the one of the Hamiltonian. Consequently, we formulate an approximation to the sqic-MRCC method with singles and doubles (included respectively up to fourfold and twofold commutators, sqic-MRCCSD[2]) that contains all terms present in the corresponding single-reference coupled cluster scheme. Computations of the potential energy curves for the dissociation of BeH(2) show that the untruncated sqic-MRCCSD scheme yields results that are almost indistinguishable from the ordinary ic-MRCCSD method. The energy obtained from the computationally less expensive sqic-MRCCSD[2] approximation is found to deviate from the full ic-MRCCSD method by less than 0.2 mE(h) for BeH(2), while, in the case of water, the harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone, the singlet-triplet splitting of p-benzyne, and the dissociation curve of N(2), sqic-MRCCSD[2] faithfully reproduces the results obtained via the ic-MRCCSD scheme truncated to two commutators. A formal proof is given of the equivalence of the ic-MRCC and sqic-MRCC methods with the internally contracted and full configuration interaction approaches.},

The generalised van Vleck perturbation theory is employed to set up the perturbation equations. It is demonstrated that this leads to a consistent and well defined theory which fulfils all important criteria of a generally applicable ab initio method: The theory is proven numerically and analytically to be size-consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations within the inactive, active and virtual orbital spaces. In contrast to most previously proposed multi-reference perturbation theories the necessary condition for a proper perturbation theory to fulfil the zeroth order perturbation equation is exactly satisfied with the RE partitioning itself without additional projectors on configurational spaces. The theory is applied to several excited states of the benchmark systems CH2, SiH2, and NH2, as well as to the lowest states of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In all cases comparisons are made with full configuration interaction results. The multi-reference (MR)-RE method is shown to provide very rapidly converging perturbation series. Energy differences between states of similar configurations converge even faster.},

abstract = {A multi-reference CI scheme is proposed which is aiming at a considerable reduction of the generally very large number of configurations of CI expansions in multi-configuration reference cases. This reduction is achieved by combining the idea of internal contraction, the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNO's) and CEPA (coupled electron pair) type approximations for the contributions of higher than double excitations. This latter estimate leads to size consistent results and also permits to employ reference wavefunctions that contain only the dominantly occupied configurations of the considered system. Applications to two test cases, the lowest states (3P,1D and1S) of the carbon atom and the symmetry forbiddenC2v insertion reaction of Be and H2, show that our method is able to truncate CI expansions to lengths of no more than 103--104 without losing more than 1--2{\{}{\%}{\}} of the correlation energy. The calculated excitation energies and energy barriers agree with the full CI results in the respective basis within about 1 kcal/mol. Thus the MC-CEPA-PNO method presents a very efficient way to obtain ``chemical accuracy'' in CI-calculations for molecular systems.},

We present a combination of the DMRG and strongly contracted NEVPT2 (DMRG-SC-NEVPT2) that uses an efficient algorithm to compute high-order reduced-density matrices from DMRG wave functions.

@article{Guo2016a,
abstract = {Multi-reference (MR) electronic structure methods, such as MR configuration interaction or MR perturbation theory, can provide reliable energies and properties for many molecular phenomena like bond breaking, excited states, transition states or magnetic properties of transition metal complexes and clusters. However, owing to their inherent complexity, most MR methods are still too computationally expensive for large systems. Therefore the development of more computationally attractive MR approaches is necessary to enable routine application for large-scale chemical systems. Among the state-of-the-art MR methods, second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an efficient, size-consistent, and intruder-state-free method. However, there are still two important bottlenecks in practical applications of NEVPT2 to large systems: (a) the high computational cost of NEVPT2 for large molecules, even with moderate active spaces and (b) the prohibitive cost for treating large active spaces. In this work, we address problem (a) by developing a linear scaling "partially contracted" NEVPT2 method. This development uses the idea of domain-based local pair natural orbitals (DLPNOs) to form a highly efficient algorithm. As shown previously in the framework of single-reference methods, the DLPNO concept leads to an enormous reduction in computational effort while at the same time providing high accuracy (approaching 99.9{\%} of the correlation energy), robustness, and black-box character. In the DLPNO approach, the virtual space is spanned by pair natural orbitals that are expanded in terms of projected atomic orbitals in large orbital domains, while the inactive space is spanned by localized orbitals. The active orbitals are left untouched. Our implementation features a highly efficient "electron pair prescreening" that skips the negligible inactive pairs. The surviving pairs are treated using the partially contracted NEVPT2 formalism. A detailed comparison between the partial and strong contraction schemes is made, with conclusions that discourage the strong contraction scheme as a basis for local correlation methods due to its non-invariance with respect to rotations in the inactive and external subspaces. A minimal set of conservatively chosen truncation thresholds controls the accuracy of the method. With the default thresholds, about 99.9{\%} of the canonical partially contracted NEVPT2 correlation energy is recovered while the crossover of the computational cost with the already very efficient canonical method occurs reasonably early; in linear chain type compounds at a chain length of around 80 atoms. Calculations are reported for systems with more than 300 atoms and 5400 basis functions.},

abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (icMRCC) method allows a highly accurate description of both static and dynamic correlation with a computational scaling similar to single reference coupled cluster theory. The authors show that the method can lose its orbital invariance and size consistency when no special care is taken in the elimination of redundant excitations. Using the BeH(2) model system, four schemes are compared which differ in their treatment of linear dependencies between excitations of different rank (such as between singles and doubles). While the energy curves agree within tens of $\mu$E(h) when truncating the cluster operator at double excitations (icMRCCSD), inclusion of triple excitations (icMRCCSDT) leads to significant differences of more than 1 mE(h). One scheme clearly yields the best results, while the others even turn out to be not size consistent. The former procedure uses genuine single and double excitations and discards those linear combinations of (spectator) double and triple excitations which have the same effect on the reference function. With this approach, the equilibrium structure and harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone obtained with icMRCCSDT are in excellent agreement with CCSDTQ. The authors further apply icMRCC methods to potential energy surfaces of HF, LiF, N(2), and to the singlet-triplet splitting of benzynes. In particular, the latter calculations have been made possible by implementing the method with the proper formal scaling using automated techniques.},

@article{Hanauer2012,
abstract = {Within the framework of a generalized normal ordering (GNO), invented by Mukherjee [1], the reduced density matrix cumulants of the (multiconfigurational) reference wave function play a central role, as they arise directly from the contraction rules. The extended Wick theorem allows contractions of an arbitrary number of active annihilators and creators through a cumulant of corresponding rank. Because the cumulant rank truncates naturally only at the number of active spin orbitals, practical applications of the GNO concept seem to rely on a fast convergence of the cumulant series, allowing one to neglect cumulants with high rank. By computing cumulant norms for selected systems (and up to rank 16), we demonstrate that the cumulants decay approximately exponentially with increasing rank for single reference cases, while the convergence is generally slower for multireference cases. When strong left–right correlation is present as in the singlet state of a dissociated N2 molecule, even the cumulant with maximum rank, $\lambda$12���−1.5 for a CAS(6,6), is not negligible per se. Besides reporting numerical results, the authors reformulate the theory of reduced density matrices and their cumulants using a notation that is particularly easy to handle, highlighting the close connection to conventional statistics. From this statistical approach, a simple interpretation of reduced density matrices and cumulants follows, according to which an n-body cumulant is a measure for the correlation between the occupation numbers of n spin orbitals. This interpretation is also valid for cumulants with ranks exceeding the number of electrons in the system.},

The latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states known as matrix product states, where operators are correspondingly represented as matrix product operators (MPOs). The MPO construction scheme presented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while retaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach, for example, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. In this way, MPOs for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and different relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an otherwise unmodified program.},

@article{Kurashige2011,
abstract = {We present a second-order perturbation theory based on a density matrix renormalization group self-consistent field (DMRG-SCF) reference function. The method reproduces the solution of the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) when the DMRG reference function is represented by a sufficiently large number of renormalized many-body basis, thereby being named DMRG-CASPT2 method. The DMRG-SCF is able to describe non-dynamical correlation with large active space that is insurmountable to the conventional CASSCF method, while the second-order perturbation theory provides an efficient description of dynamical correlation effects. The capability of our implementation is demonstrated for an application to the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, which is one of the most demanding multireference systems that require best electronic structure treatment for non-dynamical and dynamical correlation as well as large basis sets. The DMRG-CASPT2/cc-pwCV5Z calculations were performed with a large (3d double-shell) active space consisting of 28 orbitals. Our approach using large-size DMRG reference addressed the problems of why the dissociation energy is largely overestimated by CASPT2 with the small active space consisting of 12 orbitals (3d4s), and also is oversensitive to the choice of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.},

@article{Mahapatra1998,
abstract = {The traditional multi-reference coupled cluster (MRCC) methods are based on effective hamiltonian formalism and often suffer from the problem of intruders. A state-specific MRCC approach, focusing on only one state, offers the attractive possibility of avoiding intruders while at the same time incorporating the nondynamical correlation in a size-extensive manner. In this paper we discuss two alternative paradigms which allow us to achieve this goal. The first, to be called the decontracted description, we deliberately retain certain linearly dependent cluster amplitudes and allow the combining coefficients of the reference determinants to be updated to their values for the exact function. The presence of the linearly dependent cluster amplitudes requires imposition of suitable sufficiency conditions, which are invoked in a manner which naturally ensures size-extensivity. In the second approach, to be called the contracted description, we would generate a cluster expansion with respect to the entire reference function consisting of a combination of reference determinants and retain only the linearly independent cluster-amplitudes in the cluster expansion. For an efficient implementation of the formalism, we shall introduce the notion of extended normal ordering and an analogue of Wick's theorem which uses the entire reference function as the multi-determinantal analogue of the vacuum. This necessarily imposes the restriction that the combining coefficients appearing in the reference function have to remain frozen in the equations for the cluster amplitudes. Relaxation of the coefficients can be acheived only after the cluster-amplitudes with the current coefficients are solved.},

abstract = {The beryllium dimer is a deceptively simple molecule that, in spite of having only eight electrons, poses difficult challenges for ab initio quantum chemical methods. More than 100 theoretical investigations of the beryllium dimer have been published, reporting a wide range of bond lengths and dissociation energies. In contrast, there have been only a handful of experimental studies that provide data against which these models could be tested. Ultimately, the uncertain extrapolation behavior associated with the available data has prevented quantitative comparisons with theory. In our experiment, we resolve this issue by recording and analyzing spectra that sample all the bound vibrational levels of the beryllium dimer molecule's electronic ground state. After more than 70 years of research on this problem, the experimental data and theoretical models for the dimer are finally reconciled.},

abstract = {The quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) with complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field (SCF) reference functions is extended to the general multiconfiguration (MC) SCF references functions case. A computational scheme that utilizes both diagrammatic and sum-over-states approaches is presented. The second-order effective Hamiltonian is computed for the external intermediate configurations (including virtual or/and core orbitals) by the diagrammatic approach and for internal intermediate configurations (including only active orbitals) by the configuration interaction matrix-based sum-over-states approach. The method is tested on the calculations of excitation energies of H2O, potential energy curves of LiF, and valence excitation energies of H2CO. The results show that the present method yields very close results to the corresponding CAS-SCF reference QDPT results and the available experimental values. The deviations from CAS-SCF reference QDPT values are less than 0.1 eV on the average for the excitation energies of H2O and less than 1 kcal/mol for the potential energy curves of LiF. In the calculation of the valence excited energies of H2CO, the maximum deviation from available experimental values is 0.28 eV. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {We investigate tree tensor network states for quantum chemistry. Tree tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and $\pi$-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons in 110 active orbitals.},

abstract = {Linear response theory for the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG-LRT) was first presented in terms of the DMRG renormalization projectors [J. J. Dorando, J. Hachmann, and G. K.-L. Chan, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 184111 (2009)]. Later, with an understanding of the manifold structure of the matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, which lies at the basis of the DMRG algorithm, a way was found to construct the linear response space for general choices of the MPS gauge in terms of the tangent space vectors [J. Haegeman, J. I. Cirac, T. J. Osborne, I. Pižorn, H. Verschelde, and F. Verstraete, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 070601 (2011)]. These two developments led to the formulation of the Tamm-Dancoff and random phase approximations (TDA and RPA) for MPS. This work describes how these LRTs may be efficiently implemented through minor modifications of the DMRG sweep algorithm, at a computational cost which scales the same as the ground-state DMRG algorithm. In fact, the mixed canonical MPS form implicit to the DMRG sweep is essential for efficient implementation of the RPA, due to the structure of the second-order tangent space. We present ab initio DMRG-TDA results for excited states of polyenes, the water molecule, and a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster.},

The algorithm can be used together with either single- or multireference CI wave functions but assumes a spatially nondegenerate ground state. A one-electron approximation to the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) operator is used. Presently the implementation uses the INDO/S model of Zerner and coworkers. Results are presented for a representative collection of Cu(II) complexes with N-, O-, and S-containing ligands. The calculations reproduce the trends in the experimental data well and show no systematic errors. For the test set the g values are reproduced with a standard deviation of 0.021. The method has therefore a good cost–performance ratio and is expected to be helpful in chemical and biochemical applications. Further improvements are feasible and necessary and are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 83: 104–114, 2001},

Upon variational energy minimization, the network creates particle number projections that remove the charge fluctuations responsible for size inconsistency.

abstract = {Canonical transformation (CT) theory provides a rigorously size-extensive description of dynamic correlation in multireference systems, with an accuracy superior to and cost scaling lower than complete active space second order perturbation theory. Here we expand our previous theory by investigating (i) a commutator approximation that is applied at quadratic, as opposed to linear, order in the effective Hamiltonian, and (ii) incorporation of the three-body reduced density matrix in the operator and density matrix decompositions. The quadratic commutator approximation improves CT's accuracy when used with a single-determinant reference, repairing the previous formal disadvantage of the single-reference linear CT theory relative to singles and doubles coupled cluster theory. Calculations on the BH and HF binding curves confirm this improvement. In multireference systems, the three-body reduced density matrix increases the overall accuracy of the CT theory. Tests on the H(2)O and N(2) binding curves yield results highly competitive with expensive state-of-the-art multireference methods, such as the multireference Davidson-corrected configuration interaction (MRCI+Q), averaged coupled pair functional, and averaged quadratic coupled cluster theories.},

abstract = {Second order R12 theory is presented and derived alternatively using the second quantized hole-particle formalism. We have shown that in order to ensure the strong orthogonality between the R12 and the conventional part of the wave function, the explicit use of projection operators can be easily avoided by an appropriate partitioning of the involved operators to parts which are fully describable within the computational orbital basis and complementary parts that involve imaginary orbitals from the complete orbital basis. Various Hamiltonian splittings are discussed and computationally investigated for a set of nine molecules and their atomization energies. If no generalized Brillouin condition is assumed, with all relevant partitionings the one-particle contribution arising in the explicitly correlated part of the first order wave function has to be considered and has a significant role when smaller atomic orbital basis sets are used. The most appropriate Hamiltonian splitting results if one follows the conventional perturbation theory for a general non-Hartree-Fock reference. Then, no couplings between the R12 part and the conventional part arise within the first order wave function. The computationally most favorable splitting when the whole complementary part of the Hamiltonian is treated as a perturbation fails badly. These conclusions also apply to MP2-F12 approaches with different correlation factors.},

The CCGF method is applied to the calculation of vertical ionization potentials (IPs) of a number of small molecules, notably, HF, N2, CO, F2, CS, C2H4, H2O, and H2CO. The results for the outer-valence IPs, with an average error of 0.12 eV, compare favorably to third-order equation-of-motion calculations within the same basis set (average error 0.28 eV) and outer-valence GF (OVGF) values taken from the literature (average error 0.17 eV). Ground-state properties that derive from the CCGF are compared to expectation values obtained in the related normal coupled cluster methods (NCCM) approximation from a formal point of view. Correlation energies obtained in CCGF are compared to CCSD results for the above series of molecules and, in addition, the so-called true correlation energy density as obtained from the CCGF is compared to the result from an accurate MR–CI calculation for a highly correlated system: the HF molecule at large internuclear separation. {\textcopyright} 1993 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = { Interaction energies of dimers containing alkaline earth (Be, Mg, and Ca) metals have been investigated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) and supermolecular (SM) methods. Also, to enable broader comparisons, some calculations have been performed on the Zn dimer and on the He−Mg dimer. Although all of the investigated metallic atoms have closed electronic shells, the quasidegeneracy of the ground states of these atoms with the lowest-lying excited states leads to convergence problems in theories based on a single-determinant reference state. The main goal of the present work was to establish how the quality of the interaction energies computed using various electronic-structure methods changes across the range of atoms. We show that although the convergence problems become somewhat less severe with the increase of the atomic number, single-determinant-based methods do not provide reliable interaction energies for any of the investigated metallic dimers even at the level of the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. However, interaction energies accurate to within a few percent can be obtained if CCSD(T) calculations in large basis sets are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and followed by full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations with a frozen-core (FC) approximation. Since the systems considered contain only two valence electrons, FCI/FC calculations have been feasible for all of them except for Zn2, providing the best theoretical estimates of the binding energies to date. We found that a large part of the error of the SAPT results originates from limiting some exchange components to terms proportional to the squares of the intermonomer orbital overlap integrals. When the neglected terms were approximately accounted for, the accuracy improved significantly and became comparable to that of CCSD(T), allowing us to obtain for the first time a physical interpretation of the interaction energies in metallic dimers. },

abstract = {The chromium dimer (Cr2) presents an outstanding challenge for many-body electronic structure methods. Its complicated nature of binding, with a formal sextuple bond and an unusual potential energy curve (PEC), is emblematic of the competing tendencies and delicate balance found in many strongly correlated materials. We present an accurate calculation of the PEC and ground state properties of Cr2, using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. Unconstrained, exact AFQMC calculations are first carried out for a medium-sized but realistic basis set. Elimination of the remaining finite-basis errors and extrapolation to the complete basis set limit are then achieved with a combination of phaseless and exact AFQMC calculations. Final results for the PEC and spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Exact decoupling of positive- and negative-energy states in relativistic quantum chemistry is discussed in the framework of unitary transformation techniques. The obscure situation that each scheme of decoupling transformations relies on different, but very special parametrizations of the employed unitary matrices is critically analyzed. By applying the most general power series ansatz for the parametrization of the unitary matrices it is shown that all transformation protocols for decoupling the Dirac Hamiltonian have necessarily to start with an initial free-particle Foldy-Wouthuysen step. The purely numerical iteration scheme applying X-operator techniques to the Barysz-Sadlej-Snijders (BSS) Hamiltonian is compared to the analytical schemes of the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) and Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) approaches. Relying on an illegal 1/c expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian around the nonrelativistic limit, any higher-order FW transformation is in principle ill defined and doomed to fail, irrespective of the specific features of the external potential. It is shown that the DKH method is the only valid analytic unitary transformation scheme for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Its exact infinite-order version can be realized purely numerically by the BSS scheme, which is only able to yield matrix representations of the decoupled Hamiltonian but no analytic expressions for this operator. It is explained why a straightforward numerical iterative extension of the DKH procedure to arbitrary order employing matrix representations is not feasible within standard one-component electronic structure programs. A more sophisticated ansatz based on a symbolical evaluation of the DKH operators via a suitable parser routine is needed instead and introduced in Part II of this work.},

@article{Riplinger2013,
abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., {\textgreater}100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below {\textless}0.05{\%}, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ("domain based LPNO-CCSD"). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured {\textgreater}8800 basis functions and {\textgreater}450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

In this approach the strongly contracted perturber functions are projected onto a renormalized Hilbert space. Compared to a straightforward implementation of SC-NEVPT2 with DMRG wavefunctions, the computational scaling and storage requirements are reduced. This favorable scaling opens up the possibility of calculations with larger active spaces. A specially designed renormalization scheme ensures that both the electronic ground state and the perturber functions are well represented in the renormalized Hilbert space.

Large complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) computations have been performed in pursuit of an accurate ordering for the lowest several electronic states. Basis set and relativistic effects have also been considered. For the geometry considered, our best results indicate the ground spin state to be a closed-shell singlet, followed by a pair of low-lying triplet states, with additional singlet states and the lowest quintet state lying significantly higher in energy. Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) results are obtained and are compared to the more robust CASSCF results. The Hartree-Fock results are qualitatively incorrect for the relative energies of the states considered. Popular density functionals such as BP86 and B3LYP are superior to Hartree-Fock for this problem, but they give inconsistent answers regarding the ordering of the lowest singlet and triplet states and they greatly underestimate the singlet-quintet gap. We obtained multiple Hartree-Fock and DFT solutions within a given spin multiplicity, and these solutions have been subjected to wave function stability analysis.},

Phys. 136, 124121 (2012)], which described a spin-adapted (SU(2) symmetry) density matrix renormalization group algorithm, to additionally utilize general non-Abelian point group symmetries. A key strength of the present formulation is that the requisite tensor operators are not hard-coded for each symmetry group, but are instead generated on the fly using the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This allows our single implementation to easily enable (or disable) any non-Abelian point group symmetry (including SU(2) spin symmetry). We use our implementation to compute the ground state potential energy curve of the C2 dimer in the cc-pVQZ basis set (with a frozen-core), corresponding to a Hilbert space dimension of 10(12) many-body states. While our calculated energy lies within the 0.3 mEh error bound of previous initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo and correlation energy extrapolation by intrinsic scaling calculations, our estimated residual error is only 0.01 mEh, much more accurate than these previous estimates. Due to the additional efficiency afforded by the algorithm, the excitation energies (Te) of eight lowest lying excited states: a(3)$\Pi$u, b(3)$\Sigma$g (-), A(1)$\Pi$u, c(3)$\Sigma$u (+), B(1)$\Delta$g, B(') (1)$\Sigma$g (+), d(3)$\Pi$g, and C(1)$\Pi$g are calculated, which agree with experimentally derived values to better than 0.06 eV. In addition, we also compute the potential energy curves of twelve states: the three lowest levels for each of the irreducible representations (1)$\Sigma$g (+), (1)$\Sigma$u (+), (1)$\Sigma$g (-), and (1)$\Sigma$u (-), to an estimated accuracy of 0.1 mEh of the exact result in this basis.},

The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate.

Lett. 57, 852 (2002)]10.1209/epl/i2002-00393-0 to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of 2, and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E 61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

abstract = {In this work, we generalize the recently proposed matrix product state perturbation theory (MPSPT) for calculating energies of excited states using quasi-degenerate (QD) perturbation theory. Our formulation uses the Kirtman-Certain-Hirschfelder canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, which gives Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each order, and also allows one to make use of Wigner's 2n + 1 rule. Further, our formulation satisfies Granovsky's requirement of model space invariance which is important for obtaining smooth potential energy curves. Thus, when we use MPSPT with the Dyall Hamiltonian, we obtain a model space invariant version of quasi-degenerate n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT), a property that the usual formulation of QD-NEVPT2 based on a multipartitioning technique lacked. We use our method on the benchmark problems of bond breaking of LiF which shows ionic to covalent curve crossing and the twist around the double bond of ethylene where significant valence-Rydberg mixing occurs in the excited states. In accordance with our previous work, we find that multi-reference linearized coupled cluster theory is more accurate than other multi-reference theories of similar cost.},

abstract = {Iron–sulfur clusters are a universal biological motif. They carry out electron transfer, redox chemistry and even oxygen sensing, in diverse processes including nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. Their low-lying electronic states are key to their remarkable reactivity, but they cannot be directly observed. Here, we present the first ever quantum calculation of the electronic levels of {\{}{\$}[{\$}{\}}2Fe–2S{\{}{\$}]{\$}{\}} and {\{}{\$}[{\$}{\}}4Fe–4S{\{}{\$}]{\$}{\}} clusters free from any model assumptions. Our results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe dnchem.2041-m5gif110136d excitations, thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in catalysis in nature.},

A Slater-type geminal function is employed as a correlation factor to represent the electron-electron cusp of the wave function.

The centerpiece of this approach is the CCSD(2)R12 Lagrangian obtained via Lowdin partitioning of the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) Hamiltonian. Extremization of the Lagrangian yields the second-order basis set incompleteness correction for the CCSD energy. We also developed a simpler Hylleraas-type functional that only depends on one set of geminal amplitudes by applying screening approximations. This functional is used to develop a diagonal orbital-invariant version of the method in which the geminal amplitudes are fixed at the values determined by the first-order cusp conditions. Extension of the variational method to include perturbatively the effect of connected triples produces the method that approximates the complete basis-set limit of the standard CCSD plus perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method. For a set of 20 small closed-shell molecules{\{},{\}} the method recovered at least 94.5/97.3{\%} of the CBS CCSD(T) correlation energy with the aug-cc-pVDZ/aug-cc-pVTZ orbital basis set. For 12 isogyric reactions involving these molecules{\{},{\}} combining the aug-cc-pVTZ correlation energies with the aug-cc-pVQZ Hartree-Fock energies produces the electronic reaction energies with a mean absolute deviation of 1.4 kJ mol-1 from the experimental values.

abstract = {An effective Hamiltonian perturbed with explicit interelectronic correlation is derived from similarity transformation of Hamiltonian using a unitary operator with Slater-type geminals. The Slater-type geminal is projected onto the excitation (and deexcitation) component as in the F12 theory. Simplification is made by truncating higher-body operators, resulting in a correlated Hamiltonian which is Hermitian and has exactly the same complexity as the original Hamiltonian in the second quantized form. It can thus be easily combined with arbitrary correlation models proposed to date. The present approach constructs a singularity-free Hamiltonian a priori, similarly to the so-called transcorrelated theory, while the use of the canonical transformation assures that the effective Hamiltonian is two-body and Hermite. Our theory is naturally extensible to multireference calculations on the basis of the generalized normal ordering. The construction of the effective Hamiltonian is non-iterative. The numerical assessments demonstrate that the present scheme improves the basis set convergence of the post-mean-field calculations at a similar rate to the explicitly correlated methods proposed by others that couple geminals and conventional excitations.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of reducing the complexity of multireference perturbation theory through cumulant based approximations to the high-order density matrices that appear in such theories. Our test cases show that while the cumulant approximated forms are degraded in accuracy relative to the parent theory and exhibit intruder state problems that must be carefully handled, they may provide a route to a simple estimation of dynamic correlation when the parent perturbation theory is infeasible. Nonetheless, further work is clearly needed on better approximations to the denominators in the perturbation theory.},

@article{Zgid2008,
abstract = {We present a spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm designed to target spin and spatial symmetry states that can be difficult to obtain while using a non-spin-adapted algorithm. The algorithmic modifications that have to be introduced into the usual density matrix renormalization group scheme in order to spin adapt it are discussed, and it is demonstrated that the introduced modifications do not change the overall scaling of the method. The new approach is tested on HNCO, a model system, that has a singlet-triplet curve crossing between states of the same symmetry. The advantages of the spin-adapted DMRG scheme are discussed, and it is concluded that the spin-adapted DMRG method converges better in almost all cases and gives more parallel curves to the full configuration interaction result than the non-spin-adapted method. It is shown that the spin-adapted DMRG energies can be lower than the ones obtained from the non-spin-adapted scheme. Such a counterintuitive result is explained by noting that the spin-adapted method is not a special case of the non-spin-adapted one; consequently, the spin-adapted result is not an upper bound for the non-spin-adapted energy.},

@misc{bottleneck,
note = {The $N_v$ determinants in the variational space are connected to ${\cal O}(n^2v^2N_v)$ determinants in the perturbative space with non-zero Hamiltonian matrix elements,
where $n$ is the number of electrons and $v$ is the number of virtual orbitals.
For a relatively conservative number of $n=12$, $v=50$ and $N_v=10^7$, the perturbative space will contain over $10^{12}$ determinants, requiring over 10 terabyte memory.
The original HCI algorithm reduces this storage requirement by orders of magnitude by only requiring the storage of
determinants $D_a$ for which $\left|H_{ai}c_i\right|>\epsilon_2$ for
at least one determinant $D_i \in \mathcal{V}$.  Nevertheless, for many systems this is the most memory
intensive part of the original algorithm.}
