abstract = {The auxiliary‐field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method provides a computational framework for solving the time‐independent Schrödinger equation in atoms, molecules, solids, and a variety of model systems. AFQMC has recently witnessed remarkable growth, especially as a tool for electronic structure computations in real materials. The method has demonstrated excellent accuracy across a variety of correlated electron systems. Taking the form of stochastic evolution in a manifold of nonorthogonal Slater determinants, the method resembles an ensemble of density‐functional theory (DFT) calculations in the presence of fluctuating external potentials. Its computational cost scales as a low‐power of system size, similar to the corresponding independent‐electron calculations. Highly efficient and intrinsically parallel, AFQMC is able to take full advantage of contemporary high‐performance computing platforms and numerical libraries. In this review, we provide a self‐contained introduction to the exact and constrained variants of AFQMC, with emphasis on its applications to the electronic structure of molecular systems. Representative results are presented, and theoretical foundations and implementation details of the method are discussed.

Abstract = {Many recent calculations have been performed to study a Co atom adsorbed
   on graphene, with significantly varying results on the nature of the
   bonding. We use the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method and a
   size-correction embedding scheme to accurately calculate the binding
   energy of Co on graphene. We find that as a function of the distance h
   between the Co atom and the sixfold hollow site, there are three
   distinct ground states corresponding to three electronic configurations
   of the Co atom. Two of these states provide binding and exhibit a
   double-well feature with nearly equal binding energy of 0.4 eV at h =
   1.51 and h = 1.65 angstrom, corresponding to low-spin Co-2 (3d(9) 4s(0))
   and high-spin Co-4 (3d(8) 4s(1)), respectively. DOI:

Abstract = {We present a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique for calculating the
   exact finite-temperature properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures. The
   Bose-Fermi auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (BFAFQMC) algorithm
   combines two methods, a finite-temperature AFQMC algorithm for bosons
   and a variant of the standard AFQMC algorithm for fermions, into one
   algorithm for mixtures. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by
   comparing its results for the Bose-Hubbard and Bose-Fermi-Hubbard models
   against those produced using exact diagonalization for small systems.
   Comparisons are also made with mean-field theory and the worm algorithm
   for larger systems. As is the case with most fermion Hamiltonians, a
   sign or phase problem is present in the BFAFQMC algorithm. We discuss
   the nature of these problems in this framework and describe how they can
   be controlled with well-studied approximations to expand the BFAFQMC
   algorithm's reach. This algorithm can serve as an essential tool for
   answering many unresolved questions about many-body physics in mixed
   Bose-Fermi systems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {50},
Month = {Dec 21},
Abstract = {The ground states of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model are
   studied within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) theory. Magnetic and
   charge properties are determined by systematic, large-scale, exact
   numerical calculations, and quantified as a function of electron doping,
   h. In the solution of the self-consistent UHF equations, multiple
   initial configurations and simulated annealing are used to facilitate
   convergence to the global minimum. New approaches are employed to
   minimize finite-size effects in order to reach the thermodynamic limit.
   At low to moderate interacting strengths and low doping, the UHF ground
   state is a linear spin-density wave (1-SDW), with antiferromagnetic
   order and a modulating wave. The wavelength of the modulating wave is
   2/h. Corresponding charge order exists but is substantially weaker than
   the spin order, hence holes are mobile. As the interaction is increased,
   the 1-SDW states evolve into several different phases, with the holes
   eventually becoming localized. A simple pairing model is presented with
   analytic calculations for low interaction strength and small doping, to
   help understand the numerical results and provide a physical picture for
   the properties of the SDW ground state. By comparison with recent
   many-body calculations, it is shown that, for intermediate interactions,
   the UHF solution provides a good description of the magnetic
   correlations in the true ground state of the Hubbard model.},

Abstract = {We solve the zero-temperature unitary Fermi gas problem by incorporating

   many orders of magnitude for strongly paired fermions. We calculate the

   particles on lattices of up to 27(3) sites, obtaining an accurate result
   for the universal parameter xi. We also obtain results for interactions
   with different effective ranges and find that the energy is consistent
   with a universal linear dependence on the product of the Fermi momentum
   and the effective range. This method will have many applications in
   superfluid cold atom systems and in both electronic and nuclear

   ferromagnetic transition occurs, but at a critical transition point
   k(F)a much higher than predicted from previous calculations, almost all
   of which use the scattering length approximation. In the four-particle
   system the discrepancy is a factor of 2. The exact critical interaction
   strength calculated in the four-particle system is consistent with that

Month = {Dec},
Abstract = {The pressure-induced structural phase transition from diamond to beta
   tin in silicon is an excellent test for theoretical total-energy
   methods. The transition pressure provides a sensitive measure of small
   relative energy changes between the two phases (one a semiconductor and
   the other a semimetal). Experimentally, the transition pressure is well
   characterized. Density-functional results exhibit sensitivity to the
   particular form of the exchange-correlation functional. Even the
   generally much more accurate diffusion Monte Carlo method has shown a
   noticeable fixed-node error. We use the recently developed phaseless
   auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to calculate the
   relative energy differences in the two phases. In this method, all but
   the error due to the phaseless constraint can be controlled
   systematically and driven to zero. In both structural phases we were
   able to benchmark the error of the phaseless constraint by carrying out
   exact unconstrained AFQMC calculations for small supercells. Comparison
   between the two shows that the systematic error in the absolute total
   energies due to the phaseless constraint is well within 0.5 mE(h)/atom.
   Consistent with these internal benchmarks, the transition pressure
   obtained by the phaseless AFQMC from large supercells is in very good
   agreement with experiment.},

   prevention of collapse into the ground state and control of the Fermion
   sign/phase problem are accomplished by the approximate phaseless

   ground and two low-lying singlet excited states. The trial wave function
   is obtained by truncating complete active space wave functions, with no

Abstract = {In 1962, Overhauser showed that within Hartree-Fock (HF) the electron
   gas is unstable to a spin-density wave state. Determining the true HF
   ground state has remained a challenge. Using numerical calculations for
   finite systems and analytic techniques, we study the unrestricted HF
   ground state of the three-dimensional electron gas. At high density, we
   find broken spin symmetry states with a nearly constant charge density.
   Unlike previously discussed spin wave states, the observed wave vector
   of the spin-density wave is smaller than 2k(F). The broken-symmetry
   state originates from pairing instabilities at the Fermi surface, a
   model for which is proposed.},

Abstract = {Finite-size (FS) effects are a major source of error in many-body (MB)

Abstract = {The use of an approximate reference state wave function vertical bar
   Phi(r)> in electronic many-body methods can break the spin symmetry of
   Born-Oppenheimer spin-independent Hamiltonians. This can result in
   significant errors, especially when bonds are stretched or broken. A
   simple spin-projection method is introduced for auxiliary-field quantum
   Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations, which yields spin-contamination-free
   results, even with a spin-contaminated vertical bar Phi(r)>. The method
   is applied to the difficult F(2) molecule, which is unbound within
   unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). With a UHF vertical bar Phi(r)>, spin
   contamination causes large systematic errors and long equilibration
   times in AFQMC in the intermediate, bond-breaking region. The
   spin-projection method eliminates these problems and delivers an
   accurate potential energy curve from equilibrium to the dissociation

Abstract = {Bond stretching mimics different levels of electron correlation and
   provides a challenging test bed for approximate many-body computational
   methods. Using the recently developed phaseless auxiliary-field quantum
   Monte Carlo (AF QMC) method, we examine bond stretching in the
   well-studied molecules BH and N-2 and in the H-50 chain. To control the
   sign/phase problem, the phaseless AF QMC method constrains the paths in
   the auxiliary-field path integrals with an approximate phase condition
   that depends on a trial wave function. With single Slater determinants
   from unrestricted Hartree-Fock as trial wave function, the phaseless AF
   QMC method generally gives better overall accuracy and a more uniform
   behavior than the coupled cluster CCSD(T) method in mapping the
   potential-energy curve. In both BH and N-2, we also study the use of
   multiple-determinant trial wave functions from multiconfiguration
   self-consistent-field calculations. The increase in computational cost
   versus the gain in statistical and systematic accuracy are examined.

Abstract = {The authors present phaseless auxiliary-field (AF) quantum Monte Carlo

   These systems were selected to test and benchmark different aspects of
   the new phaseless AF QMC method. They include the transition state of

   well as the H2O, OH, and H2O2 molecules. Most of these systems present
   significant challenges for traditional independent-particle electronic

   phaseless AF QMC method is used either with a plane wave basis with
   pseudopotentials or with all-electron Gaussian basis sets. For some
   systems, calculations are done with both to compare and characterize the
   performance of AF QMC under different basis sets and different
   Hubbard-Stratonovich decompositions. Excellent results are obtained
   using as input single Slater determinant wave functions taken from

Abstract = {We extend the recently introduced phaseless auxiliary-field quantum
   Monte Carlo (QMC) approach to any single-particle basis and apply it to

   favorably with the system size as a low power. A QMC approach with

Abstract = {To treat interacting quantum systems, it is often crucial to have
   accurate calculations beyond the mean-field level. Many-body simulations
   based on field-theoretical approaches are a promising tool for this
   purpose and are applied in several subfields of physics, in closely
   related forms. An major difficulty is the sign or phase problem, which
   causes the Monte Carlo variance to increase exponentially with system
   size. We address this issue in the context of auxiliary-field
   simulations of realistic electronic systems in condensed matter physics.
   We show how to use importance sampling of the complex fields to control
   the phase problem. An approximate approach is formulated with a trial
   determinant to constrain the paths in field space and completely
   eliminate the growth of the noise. For ab initio electronic structure
   calculations, this gives a many-body approach in the form of a
   ``coherent{''} superposition of mean-field calculations, allowing direct
   incorporation of state-of-the-art technology from the latter (non-local
   pseudopotentials; high quality basis sets, etc.). In our test
   calculations, single Slater determinants from density functional theory
   or Hartree-Fock calculations were used as trial wave functions, with no

Abstract = {The growth rates and chemical ordering of ferroelectric alloys are

Abstract = {We study vicinal crystal surfaces within the terrace-step-kink model on

   discover a series of phases in which steps coalesce into bunches of n(b)

   short- to long-range interaction strengths. For bunches with large
   number of steps, we show that, at T=0, our bunch phases correspond to
   the well-known periodic groove structure first predicted by Marchenko.
   An extension to T>0 is developed. We propose that the bunch phases have
   been observed in very recent experiments on Si surfaces, and we advance
   a conjecture explaining the exponent beta approximate to0.5 describing
   the shape of the observed phase transition curves. Further experiments

Abstract = {We study vicinal crystal surfaces with the terrace-step-kink model on a
   discrete lattice. Including both a short-ranged attractive interaction
   and a long-ranged repulsive interaction arising from elastic forces, we
   discover a series of phases in which steps coalesce into bunches of n
   steps each. The value of n varies with temperature and the ratio of
   short- to long-range interaction strengths. We propose that the bunch
   phases have been observed in very recent experiments on Si surfaces. In
   a mapping of the model to a system of bosons on a 1D lattice, the bunch
   phases appear as quantum n-mers. {[}S0031-9007(98)07291-3].},

Abstract = {We simulated the three-band Hubbard model using the constrained-path
   Monte Carlo (CPMC) method in search for a possible superconducting
   ground state. The CPMC is a ground-state method that is free of the
   exponential scaling of computing time with system size. We calculated
   the binding energy of a pair of holes for systems up to 6x4 unit cells.
   We also studied the pairing correlation functions versus distance for
   both the d-wave and extended s-wave channels in systems up to 6x6. We
   found that holes bind for a wide range of parameters and that the
   binding increased as the system size is increased. However, the pairing
   correlation functions decay quickly with distance. For the extended s
   channel, we found that as the Coulomb interaction U-d on the Cu sites is
   increased, the long-range part of the correlation functions is
   suppressed and fluctuates around zero. For the d(x)2(-y)2 channel, we
   found that the correlations decay rapidly with distance towards a small
   positive value. However, this value becomes smaller as the interaction
   U-d Or the system size is increased. {[}S0163-1829(98)10919-0].},

   For small lattice sizes and weak interactions, we find that the d(x2-y2)
   pairing correlations are stronger than the extended s pairing
   correlations and are positive when the pair separation exceeds several
   lattice constants. As the system size or the interaction strength
   increases, the magnitude of the long-range part of both correlation

Abstract = {We describe and discuss a recently proposed quantum Monte Carlo
   algorithm to compute the ground-state properties of various systems of
   interacting fermions. In this method, the ground state is projected fi
   om an initial wave function by a branching random walk in an
   overcomplete basis of Slater determinants. By constraining the
   determinants according to a trial wave function \textbackslash{}psi(T)],
   we remove the exponential decay of signal-to-noise ratio characteristic
   of the sign problem. The method is variational and is exact if
   \textbackslash{}psi(T)] is exact. We illustrate the method by describing
   in detail its implementation for the two-dimensional one-hand Hubbard
   model. We show results for lattice sizes up to 16x16 and for various
   electron fillings and interaction strengths. With simple
   single-determinant wave functions as \textbackslash{}psi(T)], the method
   yields accurate (often to within a few percent) estimates of the
   ground-state energy as well as correlation functions, such as those for
   electron pairing. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the

Abstract = {We propose a bilinear sampling algorithm in the Green's function Monte
   Carlo for expectation values of operators that do not commute with the
   Hamiltonian and for differences between eigenvalues of different
   Hamiltonians. The integral representations of the Schrodinger equations
   are transformed into two equations whose solution has the form psi(a)(x)
   t(x, y) psi(b)(y), where psi(a) and psi(b) are the wavefunctions for the
   two related systems and t(x, y) is a kernel chosen to couple x and y.
   The Monte Carlo process, with random walkers on the enlarged
   configuration space x X y, solves these equations by generating
   densities whose asymptotic form is the above bilinear distribution. With
   such a distribution, exact Monte Carlo estimators can be obtained for
   the expectation values of quantum operators and for energy differences.
   We present results of these methods applied to  several test problems,
   including a model integral equation, and the hydrogen atom.},
