	abstract = {SummaryThe first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate experimental data allow the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational estimate of the connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] yields spectroscopic constants (γe, ωe, andD0) in good agreement with experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF) approach yields π orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen. This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF) works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is found to be very difficult.},

Quantum defects for nd and ns series were obtained. Series converging to some excited ion core levels do not show detectable s–d mixing, which would provide a direct ionization channel and lead to the asymmetric line shapes that are characteristic of autoionization. Fano q parameters were determined for states autoionizing without a change in core configuration. Resolved spectra of low-lying Rydberg states display a complicated level structure not observed in studies of alkali or rare-gas atoms.},

	abstract = {Python-based simulations of chemistry framework (PySCF) is a general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the ground up to emphasize code simplicity, so as to facilitate new method development and enable flexible computational workflows. The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper, we document the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the PySCF package.

	abstract = {We investigate the performance of contemporary semilocal and hybrid density functionals for bond energetics, structures, dipole moments, and harmonic frequencies of 3 d transition-metal (TM) compounds by comparison with gas-phase experiments. Special attention is given to the nonempirical metageneralized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) [Phys. Rev. Lett.91, 146401 (2003)], which has been implemented in TURBOMOLE for the present work. Trends and error patterns for classes of homologous compounds are analyzed, including dimers, monohydrides, mononitrides, monoxides, monofluorides, polyatomic oxides and halogenides, carbonyls, and complexes with organic $\pi$ ligands such as benzene and cyclopentadienyl. Weakly bound systems such as Ca 2 , Mn 2 , and Zn 2 are discussed. We propose a reference set of reactionenergies for benchmark purposes. Our all-electron results with quadruple zeta valence basis sets validate semilocal density-functional theory as the workhorse of computational TM chemistry. Typical errors in bondenergies are substantially larger than in (organic) main group chemistry, however. The Becke-Perdew{\textquoteright}86 [Phys. Rev. A38, 3098 (1988); Phys. Rev. B33, 8822 (1986)] GGA and the TPSS meta-GGA have the best price/performance ratio, while the TPSS hybrid functional achieves a slightly lower mean absolute error in bondenergies. The popular Becke three-parameter hybrid B3LYP underbinds significantly and tends to overestimate bond distances; we give a possible explanation for this. We further show that hybrid mixing does not reduce the width of the error distribution on our reference set. The error of a functional for the s - d transfer energy of a TM atom does not predict its error for TM bondenergies and bond lengths. For semilocal functionals, self-interaction error in one- and three-electron bonds appears to be a major source of error in TM reactionenergies. Nevertheless, TPSS predicts the correct ground-state symmetry in the vast majority of cases and rarely fails qualitatively. This further confirms TPSS as a general purpose functional that works throughout the periodic table. We also give workstation timing comparisons for the 645-atom protein crambin.},

In this work, we studied the electronic structures of Fe2+ ion, gaseous FeO and 14 iron complexes using Kohn{\textendash}Sham density functional theory with particular focus on determining the ground spin state of these species as well as the magnitudes of relevant spin-state energy splittings. The 14 iron complexes investigated in this work have hexacoordinate geometries of which seven are Fe(II), five are Fe(III) and two are Fe(IV) complexes. These are calculated using 20 exchange{\textendash}correlation functionals. In particular, we use a local spin density approximation (LSDA) {\textendash} GVWN5, four generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) {\textendash} BLYP, PBE, OPBE and OLYP, two non-separable gradient approximations (NGAs) {\textendash} GAM and N12, two meta-GGAs {\textendash} M06-L and M11-L, a meta-NGA {\textendash} MN15-L, five hybrid GGAs {\textendash} B3LYP, B3LYP*, PBE0, B97-3 and SOGGA11-X, four hybrid meta-GGAs {\textendash} M06, PW6B95, MPW1B95 and M08-SO and a hybrid meta-NGA {\textendash} MN15. The density functional results are compared to reference data, which include experimental results as well as the results of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations and ligand field theory estimates from the literature. For the Fe2+ ion, all functionals except M11-L correctly predict the ground spin state to be quintet. However, quantitatively, most of the functionals are not close to the experimentally determined spin-state splitting energies. For FeO all functionals predict quintet to be the ground spin state. For the 14 iron complexes, the hybrid functionals B3LYP, MPW1B95 and MN15 correctly predict the ground spin state of 13 out of 14 complexes and PW6B95 gets all the 14 complexes right. The local functionals, OPBE, OLYP and M06-L, predict the correct ground spin state for 12 out of 14 complexes. Two of the tested functionals are not recommended to be used for this type of study, in particular M08-SO and M11-L, because M08-SO systematically overstabilizes the high spin state, and M11-L systematically overstabilizes the low spin state.},

	abstract = {Coupled-cluster (CC) methods have been extensively used as the high-level approach in quantum electronic structure theory to predict various properties of molecules when experimental results are unavailable. It is often assumed that CC methods, if they include at least up to connected-triple-excitation quasiperturbative corrections to a full treatment of single and double excitations (in particular, CCSD(T)), and a very large basis set, are more accurate than Kohn{\textendash}Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT). In the present work, we tested and compared the performance of standard CC and KS methods on bond energy calculations of 20 3d transition metal-containing diatomic molecules against the most reliable experimental data available, as collected in a database called 3dMLBE20. It is found that, although the CCSD(T) and higher levels CC methods have mean unsigned deviations from experiment that are smaller than most exchange-correlation functionals for metal{\textendash}ligand bond energies of transition metals, the improvement is less than one standard deviation of the mean unsigned deviation. Furthermore, on average, almost half of the 42 exchange-correlation functionals that we tested are closer to experiment than CCSD(T) with the same extended basis set for the same molecule. The results show that, when both relativistic and core{\textendash}valence correlation effects are considered, even the very high-level (expensive) CC method with single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple cluster operators, namely, CCSDT(2)Q, averaged over 20 bond energies, gives a mean unsigned deviation (MUD(20) = 4.7 kcal/mol when one correlates only valence, 3p, and 3s electrons of transition metals and only valence electrons of ligands, or 4.6 kcal/mol when one correlates all core electrons except for 1s shells of transition metals, S, and Cl); and that is similar to some good xc functionals (e.g., B97-1 (MUD(20) = 4.5 kcal/mol) and PW6B95 (MUD(20) = 4.9 kcal/mol)) when the same basis set is used. We found that, for both coupled cluster calculations and KS calculations, the T1 diagnostics correlate the errors better than either the M diagnostics or the B1 DFT-based diagnostics. The potential use of practical standard CC methods as a benchmark theory is further confounded by the finding that CC and DFT methods usually have different signs of the error. We conclude that the available experimental data do not provide a justification for using conventional single-reference CC theory calculations to validate or test xc functionals for systems involving 3d transition metals.},

In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is $\omega$B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-L-D3. The best hybrid GGAs are $\omega$B97X-V, $\omega$B97X-D3, and $\omega$B97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides $\omega$B97M-V) include $\omega$M05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant self-interaction/delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects.},

	abstract = {The recently developed DLPNO{\textendash}CCSD(T) method and seven popular DFT functionals (B3LYP, M06, M06L, PBE, PBE0, TPSS, and TPSSh) with and without an empirical dispersion term have been tested to reproduce 111 gas phase reaction enthalpies involving 11 different transition metals. Our calculations, corrected for both relativistic effects and basis set incompleteness, indicate that most of the methods applied with default settings perform with acceptable accuracy on average. Nevertheless, our calculations also evidenced unexpected and nonsystematic large deviations for specific cases. For group 12 metals (Zn, Cd, Hg), most of the methods provided mean unsigned errors (MUE) less than 5.0 kcal/mol, with DLPNO{\textendash}CCSD(T) and PBE methods performing excellently (MUE lower 2.0 kcal/mol). Problems started with group 4 metals (Ti and Zr). The best performer for Zr complexes with MUE of 1.8 kcal/mol, PBE0-D3, provides MUE larger than 8 kcal/mol for Ti. DLPNO{\textendash}CCSD(T) provides a reasonable MUE of 3.3 kcal/mol for Ti reactions but gives MUE a larger than 14.4 kcal/mol for Zr complexes, with all the larger deviations for reactions involving ZrF4. Large and nonsystematic errors have been obtained for group 6 metals (Mo and W), for eight reactions containing Fe, Cu, Nb, and Re complexes. Finally, for the whole set of 111 reactions, the DLPNO{\textendash}CCSD(T), B3LYP-D3, and PBE0-D3 methods turned out to be the best performers, all providing MUE below 5.0 kcal/mol. Since DFT results cannot be systematically improved and large nonsystematic deviations of 20{\textendash}30 kcal/mol were obtained even for best performers, our results indicate that current DFT methods are still unable to provide robust predictions in transition metal thermochemistry, at least for the functionals explored in this work. The same conclusion holds for both DLPNO{\textendash}CCSD(T) and canonical CCSD(T) methods when used entirely as out-of-the-box. However, if careful investigation of core correlation is performed, relativistic effects are properly included and the quality of the reference wave function is properly checked, CCSD(T) methods can still provide good quality results that might even be used to validate DFT methods due to paucity of accurate thermodynamic data for realistic-sized transition metal complexes.},

For the first time, quantum Monte Carlo orbital optimization for transition metal compounds is performed. It is demonstrated that energy optimization of the orbitals of a complete active space wave function in the presence of a Jastrow correlation function is required to obtain agreement with the experimental dissociation energy. Furthermore, it is shown that orbital optimization leads to a 5$\Delta$ ground state, in agreement with experiments but in disagreement with other high-level ab initio wave function calculations which all predict a 5$\Sigma$+ ground state. The role of the Jastrow factor in DMC calculations with pseudopotentials is investigated. The results suggest that a large Jastrow factor may improve the DMC accuracy substantially at small additional cost.},

	abstract = {Whither the density in DFT calculations?
The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev et al. examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density.
Science, this issue p. 49; see also p. 28
The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.
Certain recent approaches to density functional theory have sacrificed fidelity to the true electron density.

	abstract = {The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.},

Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry{\textemdash}calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He{\textendash}H+.

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.},

Title = {Optimization of quantum Monte Carlo wave functions by energy
   minimization},
Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {126},
Number = {8},
Month = {Feb 28},
Abstract = {We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy
   minimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear,
   and perturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations
   are calculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced
   variance statistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the
   parameter variations are found by diagonalizing a nonsymmetric estimator
   of the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and
   its derivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong
   zero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive
   perturbative method, the parameter variations are calculated by
   approximately solving the generalized eigenvalue equation of the linear
   method by a nonorthogonal perturbation theory. These general methods are
   illustrated here by the optimization of wave functions consisting of a
   Jastrow factor multiplied by an expansion in configuration state
   functions (CSFs) for the C(2) molecule, including both valence and core
   electrons in the calculation. The Newton and linear methods are very
   efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF, and orbital
   parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the
   optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the
   optimization is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we
   observe for the C(2) molecule studied here, and for other systems we
   have studied, that as more parameters in the trial wave functions are
   optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo total energy improves
   monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also improves
   monotonically. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We pursue the development and application of the recently introduced linear optimization method for determining the optimal linear and nonlinear parameters of Jastrow–Slater wave functions in a variational Monte Carlo framework. In this approach, the optimal parameters are found iteratively by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its first-order derivatives, making use of a strong zero-variance principle. We extend the method to optimize the exponents of the basis functions, simultaneously with all the other parameters, namely, the Jastrow, configuration state function, and orbital parameters. We show that the linear optimization method can be thought of as a so-called augmented Hessian approach, which helps explain the robustness of the method and permits us to extend it to minimize a linear combination of the energy and the energy variance. We apply the linear optimization method to obtain the complete ground-state potential energy curve of the C 2 molecule up to the dissociation limit and discuss size consistency and broken spin-symmetry issues in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We perform calculations for the first-row atoms and homonuclear diatomic molecules with fully optimized Jastrow–Slater wave functions, and we demonstrate that molecular well depths can be obtained with near chemical accuracy quite systematically at the diffusion Monte Carlo level for these systems.},

abstract = {The auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method provides a computational framework for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation in atoms, molecules, solids, and a variety of model systems. AFQMC has recently witnessed remarkable growth, especially as a tool for electronic structure computations in real materials. The method has demonstrated excellent accuracy across a variety of correlated electron systems. Taking the form of stochastic evolution in a manifold of nonorthogonal Slater determinants, the method resembles an ensemble of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations in the presence of fluctuating external potentials. Its computational cost scales as a low-power of system size, similar to the corresponding independent-electron calculations. Highly efficient and intrinsically parallel, AFQMC is able to take full advantage of contemporary high-performance computing platforms and numerical libraries. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to the exact and constrained variants of AFQMC, with emphasis on its applications to the electronic structure of molecular systems. Representative results are presented, and theoretical foundations and implementation details of the method are discussed.

We investigate the possibility of using multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions with non-orthogonal determinants by optimizing identical single particle orbitals independently in separate determinants. As a test case, we compute variational and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) energies of a C2 molecule. For a given multi-determinant expansion, we find that this non-orthogonal orbital optimization results in a consistent improvement in the variational energy and the FN-DMC energy on the order of a few tenths of an eV. In some cases, fewer non-orthogonal determinants are required compared to orthogonal ones in order to achieve similar accuracy in FN-DMC. Our calculations indicate that trial wave functions with non-orthogonal determinants can improve computed energies in a QMC calculation when compared to their orthogonal counterparts.},

   reduces the memory requirements by more than a factor of two. An
   extrapolation technique is introduced to reliably extrapolate HCI
   energies to the full CI limit. The resulting algorithm is used to
   compute fourteen low-lying potential energy surfaces of the carbon dimer
   using the cc-pV5Z basis set, with an estimated error in energy of 30-50
   mu Ha compared to full CI. The excitation energies obtained using our
   algorithm have a mean absolute deviation of 0.02 eV compared to
   experimental values. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {We extend the recently proposed heat-bath configuration interaction
   (HCI) method {[}Holmes, Tubman, Umrigar, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016,
   12, 3674], by introducing a semistochastic algorithm for performing
   multireference Epstein -Nesbet perturbation theory, in order to
   completely eliminate the severe memory bottleneck of the original
   method. The proposed algorithm has several attractive features. First,
   there is no sign problem that plagues several quantum Monte Carlo
   methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis Hastings sampling, we use
   the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the reference wave
   function, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples. Third,
   in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI)
   is faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a
   stochastic error of 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI
   algorithm one can trade memory for a modest increase in computer time.
   Fifth, the perturbative calculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI
   algorithm extends the range of applicability of the original algorithm,
   allowing us to calculate the correlation energy of very large active
   spaces. We demonstrate this by performing calculations on several first
   row dimers including F-2 with an active space of (14e, 108o), Mn-Salen
   cluster with an active space of (28e, 22o), and Cr-2 dimer with up to a
   quadruple-zeta( basis set with an active space of (12e, 190o). For these
   systems we were able to obtain better than 1 mHa accuracy with a wall
   time of merely 55 s, 37 s, and 56 min on 1, 1, and 4 nodes,
   respectively.},

Pages = {3674-3680},
Year = {2016}}
Abstract = {We introduce a new selected configuration interaction plus perturbation
   theory algorithm that is based on a deterministic analog of our recent
   efficient heat-bath sampling algorithm. This Heat-bath Configuration
   Interaction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the
   trade-off between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection
   of determinants to add to a variational wave function and one which
   controls the selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative
   correction to the variational energy. We show that HCI provides an
   accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing
   the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the
   cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by
   recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon
   dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly correlated chromium dimer in
   the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of
   better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core. These systems
   have full variational spaces of 3 x 10(14) and 2 x 10(22) determinants,

Title = {Efficient Heat-Bath Sampling in Fock Space},
Journal = {J. Chem. Theory Comput.},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for sampling many-body
quantum states in Fock space. The algorithm efficiently samples states
with probability approximately proportional to an arbitrary function of the
second-quantized Hamiltonian matrix element connecting the sampled
state to the current state. We apply the new sampling algorithm to the
recently developed semistochastic full configuration interaction quantum
Monte Carlo (S-FCIQMC) method, a semistochastic implementation of
the power method for projecting out the ground state energy in a basis of
Slater determinants. Our new sampling method requires modest additional
computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling but
results in newly spawned weights that are approximately of the same
magnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A
comparison in efficiency between our sampling algorithm and uniform
sampling is performed on the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning’s cc-pVXZ basis sets with X ∈ {D, T, Q , 5},
demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that increases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is performed on
three all-electron first-row dimers, B$_2$ , N$_2$, and F$_2$, in a cc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to
uniform sampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.},

The authors use trial wave functions of four types: single-determinant Slater-Jastrow wave functions, multideterminant Slater-Jastrow wave functions, single-determinant Slater-Jastrow wave functions with backflow transformations, and multideterminant Slater-Jastrow wave functions with backflow transformations. At the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo level and using their multideterminant Slater-Jastrow wave functions with backflow transformations, they recover 99\% or more of the correlation energies for Li, Be, B, C, N, and Ne, 97\% for O, and 98\% for F.},

	abstract = {The central quantity of density functional theory is the so-called exchange–correlation functional. This quantity encompasses all non-trivial many-body effects of the ground-state and has to be approximated in any practical application of the theory. For the past 50 years, hundreds of such approximations have appeared, with many successfully persisting in the electronic structure community and literature. Here, we present a library that contains routines to evaluate many of these functionals (around 180) and their derivatives.

Computer: All. Operating system: All. RAM: N.A. Classification: 7.3, 16.1. Nature of problem: Evaluation of the exchange–correlation energy functional and its derivatives. This is a fundamental part of any atomic, molecular, or solid-state code that uses density-functional theory. Solution method: The values of the energy functional and its derivatives are given in a real grid of mesh points. Running time: Typically much smaller than the remainder of the electronic structure code. The running time has a natural linear scaling with the number of grid points.},

    the quasiparticle contribution and the so-called incoherent
    contribution. We consider various strengths of the external
    potential. For two different starting points of the
    self-consistency cycle, local-density approximation and
    Hartree-Fock, the band gaps converge to the same values. The
    self-consistent GW band gaps differ very little from the
    Hartree-Fock band gaps. There is considerable disagreement with
    quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the same model, indicating
    the importance of vertex corrections.}

               generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for 15
               nonmetallic materials for its use as a starting point
               in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation

functional theory fail badly with this test. They consequently present
a localization or delocalization error, resulting in a highest

available framework to describe particle number changes. The small
remaining error can be further reduced by devising a DeltaSCF-like

From a fundamental point of view, the method is self-correlation free for one-electron systems. From a practical point of view, the approach yields correlation energies for atoms, as well as for the jellium electron gas within a few kcal/mol of exact values, atomization energies within typically 2\u20133 kcal/mol of experiment, and excellent lattice constants for ionic and covalently bonded solids (0.2% error). The computational complexity is only O(N5), comparable to canonical second-order M√∏ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory, which should allow for routine calculations on many systems.}

   abstract = {The random phase approximation RPA is an increasingly popular post-Kohn\u2013Sham correlation
method, but its high computational cost has limited molecular applications to systems with few
atoms. Here we present an efficient implementation of RPA correlation energies based on a
combination of resolution of the identity RI and imaginary frequency integration techniques. We
show that the RI approximation to four-index electron repulsion integrals leads to a variational
upper bound to the exact RPA correlation energy if the Coulomb metric is used. Auxiliary basis sets
optimized for second-order Moller-Plesset MP2 calculations are well suitable for RPA, as is
demonstrated for the HEAT A. Tajti et al., J. Chem. Phys. 121, 11599 2004 and MOLEKEL
F. Weigend et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 294, 143 1998 benchmark sets. Using imaginary frequency
integration rather than diagonalization to compute the matrix square root necessary for RPA,
evaluation of the RPA correlation energy requires ON4 log N operations and ON3 storage only;
the price for this dramatic improvement over existing algorithms is a numerical quadrature. We
propose a numerical integration scheme that is exact in the two-orbital case and converges
exponentially with the number of grid points. For most systems, 30\u201340 grid points yield H
accuracy in triple zeta basis sets, but much larger grids are necessary for small gap systems. The
lowest-order approximation to the present method is a post-Kohn\u2013Sham frequency-domain version
of opposite-spin Laplace-transform RI-MP2 J. Jung et al., Phys. Rev. B 70, 205107 2004.
Timings for polyacenes with up to 30 atoms show speed-ups of two orders of magnitude over
previous implementations. The present approach makes it possible to routinely compute RPA
correlation energies of systems well beyond 100 atoms, as is demonstrated for the octapeptide
angiotensin II.}

We also found a double branch along Ni(111) which is not observed experimentally.

               It allows us to consider such correlation effects as

   within the GW approximation, which we call quasiparticle
   self-consistent GW (QSGW). We have shown that QSGW describes energy

   where the local-density approximation fails. QSGW contains physical
   effects found in other theories such as LDA+U, self-interaction
   correction, and GW in a satisfactory manner without many of their
   drawbacks (partitioning of itinerant and localized electrons,
   adjustable parameters, ambiguities in double counting, etc.). We
   present some theoretical discussion concerning the formulation of
   QSGW, including a prescription for calculating the total energy. We
   also address several key methodological points needed for
   implementation. We then show convergence checks and some
   representative results in a variety of materials.}
