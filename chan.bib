Abstract = {{We marry tensor network states (TNS) and projector quantum Monte Carlo (PMC) to overcome the high computational scaling of TNS and the sign problem of PMC. Using TNS as trial wave functions provides a route to systematically improve the sign structure and to eliminate the bias in fixed-node and constrained-path PMC. As a specific example, we describe phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with matrix product states (MPS-AFQMC). MPS-AFQMC improves significantly on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground-state energy. For the J1−J2 model on two-dimensional square lattices, we observe with MPS-AFQMC an order of magnitude reduction in the error for all couplings, compared to DMRG. The improvement is independent of walker bond dimension, and we therefore use bond dimension 1 for the walkers. The computational cost of MPS-AFQMC is then quadratic in the bond dimension of the trial wave function, which is lower than the cubic scaling of DMRG. The error due to the constrained-path bias is proportional to the variational error of the trial wave function. We show that for the J1−J2 model on two-dimensional square lattices, a linear extrapolation of the MPS-AFQMC energy with the discarded weight from the DMRG calculation allows us to remove the constrained-path bias. Extensions to other tensor networks are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate tree tensor network states for quantum chemistry. Tree
   tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of

   While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement
   structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement
   structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general
   molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm
   for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization
   which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our
   efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of
   tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out
   benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and
   pi-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen
   chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor
   network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the
   same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether
   this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to
   the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree
   algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily
   superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest

Abstract = {{A local method based on orbital specific virtuals (OSVs) for calculating

   calculations is presented. In contrast to the previous approach based on
   projected atomic orbitals (PAOs), described by Schutz {[}J. Chem. Phys.
   113, 9986 (2000)], the new scheme works without any ad hoc truncations
   of the virtual space to domains. A single threshold defines the pair and
   triple specific virtual spaces completely and automatically. It is
   demonstrated that the computational cost of the method scales linearly
   with molecular size. Employing the recommended threshold a similar
   fraction of the correlation energy is recovered as with the original PAO
   method at a somewhat lower cost. A benchmark for 52 reactions
   demonstrates that for reaction energies the intrinsic accuracy of the
   coupled cluster with singles and doubles excitations and a perturbative
   treatment of triples excitations method can be reached by OSV-local
   coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles and perturbative
   triples, provided a MP2 correction is applied that accounts for basis

   application example the interaction energies of the guanine-cytosine

Abstract = {{The development of polynomial cost solvers for correlated quantum
   impurity models, with controllable errors, is a central challenge in

   from nanoscience to the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Here, we
   describe how configuration interaction (CI) approximations to exact
   diagonalization (ED) may be used as solvers in DMFT. CI approximations
   retain the main advantages of ED, such as the ability to treat general
   interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations and to obtain real spectral
   information, but are of polynomial cost. Furthermore, their errors can
   be controlled by monitoring the convergence of physical quantities as a
   function of the CI hierarchy. Using benchmark DMFT applications, such as
   single-site DMFT of the one-dimensional Hubbard model and 2 x 2 cluster
   DMFT of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, we show that CI

   strengths including ``difficult{''} regimes, such as in the pseudogap

   OSV-MP2 recovers smooth potential energy surfaces regardless of the

Abstract = {{We extend the spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
   algorithm of McCulloch and Gulacsi {[}Europhys. Lett. 57, 852 (2002)] to
   quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density
   matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions
   of (S) over cap (2), and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall
   storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG
   algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we
   also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki {[}Phys.
   Rev. E 61, 3199 (2000)] where we target high spin states as a component
   of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient
   algorithm to calculate one-and two-body reduced density matrices from
   the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with
   benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models.
   These include the Fe2S2, {[}Fe2S2(SCH3)(4)](2-), and Cr-2 systems. In
   the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale,
   and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In
   {[}Fe2S2(SCH3)(4)](2-), we calculate particle and spin correlation
   functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the
   electronic structure. In Cr-2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with
   the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an
   order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these
   calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to
   extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal
   problems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{Jan 5}},
Abstract = {{We present a technique for optimizing hundreds of thousands of
   variational parameters in variational quantum Monte Carlo. By
   introducing iterative Krylov subspace solvers and by multiplying by the
   Hamiltonian and overlap matrices as they are sampled, we remove the need
   to construct and store these matrices and thus bypass the most expensive
   steps of the stochastic reconfiguration and linear method optimization
   techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by using
   stochastic reconfiguration to optimize a correlator product state wave
   function with a Pfaffian reference for four example systems. In two
   examples on the two dimensional Fermionic Hubbard model, we study 16 and
   64 site lattices, recovering energies accurate to 1\% in the smaller
   lattice and predicting particle-hole phase separation in the larger. In
   two examples involving an ab initio Hamiltonian, we investigate the
   potential energy curve of a symmetrically dissociated 4 x 4 hydrogen
   lattice as well as the singlet-triplet gap in free base porphin. In the
   hydrogen system we recover 98\% or more of the correlation energy at all
   geometries, while for porphin we compute the gap in a 24 orbital active
   space to within 0.02 eV of the exact result. The number of variational
   parameters in these examples ranges from 4 x 10(3) to 5 x 10(5).}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the conductance of individual optically switchable
   dithienylethene molecules in birth their conducting closed configuration
   and nonconducting open configuration, using the technique of repeatedly
   formed break-junctions. We employed pyridine groups to link the
   molecules to gold electrodes in order to achieve relatively well-defined
   molecular contacts and stable conductance. For the closed form of each
   molecule, we observed a peak in the conductance histogram constructed
   without any data selection, allowing us to determine the conductance of
   the fully stretched molecules. For two different dithlenylethene
   derivatives, these closed-configuration conductances were (3.3 +/- 0.5)
   x 10(-5) 60 and (1.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-6) Go, where 60 is the conductance
   quantum. For the open configuration of the molecules, the existence of
   electrical conduction via the molecule was evident in traces of
   conductance versus junction displacement, but the conductance of the
   fully stretched molecules was less than the noise floor of our
   measurement. We can set a lower limit of 30 for the on/off ratio for the
   simplest dithienylethene derivative we have investigated. Density

Abstract = {{We investigate the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) from a quantum

   extend quantum chemical methods for finite systems to infinite periodic

   and impurity solvers for DMFT. Here, we explore some ways in which these
   things may be achieved. First, we present an informal overview of
   dynamical mean-field theory to connect to quantum chemical language.
   Next, we describe an implementation of dynamical mean-field theory where
   we start from an ab initio Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian that avoids double
   counting issues present in many applications of DMFT. We then explore
   the use of the configuration interaction hierarchy in DMFT as an
   approximate solver for the impurity problem. We also investigate some
   numerical issues of convergence within DMFT. Our studies are carried out

   each occupied orbital is associated with a small set of correlating

   projected atomic orbital representation in Pulay-Saebo local correlation
   theories and pair natural orbital correlation theories. We have tested
   the orbital-specific virtual approximations on a variety of systems and

   the nanotubes is determined by their shape, but the intensity and
   spectrum of the scattered radiation are determined by exciton dynamics,
   quantum-dot-like optical resonances and other intrinsic properties.
   Moreover, the nanotubes display a uniform peak optical conductivity of
   similar to 8 e(2)/h, which we derive using an exciton model, suggesting
   universal behaviour similar to that observed in nanotube conductance. We
   further demonstrate a radiative coupling between two distant nanotubes,

   that many multireference dynamic correlation methods display
   unsatisfactory characteristics, including lack of size-consistency, a

Abstract = {{An algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the iterative
   optimization of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)
   wavefunction so as to find a optimum solution in fewer macroiterations
   is described. The algorithm is oriented to large-scale CASSCF problems
   that are to be solved with a combination of density matrix
   renormalization group (DMRG) method for the configuration interaction
   (CI) process. The algorithm is based on the alternating (or two-step)
   CASSCF optimization in which the CI and molecular orbital (MO)
   parameters are optimized separately. Convergence ratio is improved by
   finding further optimized MOs from a linear extrapolation of the MO sets
   of the iteration history. The acceleration results in fewer
   diagonalizations in a total CASSCF calculation to save a considerable
   computational cost. The convergence performance is examined in a couple
   of realistic applications on SiC(3) and poly (phenyl)carbenes. For
   poly(phenyl)carbenes, the large-size CASSCF calculations with
   CAS(30e,30o) that entails full pi valence space as well as sp(2) orbital
   space of carbenes are performed by using the practical implementation of
   DMRG-CASSCF in conjunction with the acceleration technique. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Canonical transformation (CT) theory provides a rigorously
   size-extensive description of dynamic correlation in multireference
   systems, with an accuracy superior to and cost scaling lower than
   complete active space second order perturbation theory. Here we expand
   our previous theory by investigating (i) a commutator approximation that
   is applied at quadratic, as opposed to linear, order in the effective
   Hamiltonian, and (ii) incorporation of the three-body reduced density
   matrix in the operator and density matrix decompositions. The quadratic
   commutator approximation improves CT's accuracy when used with a
   single-determinant reference, repairing the previous formal disadvantage
   of the single-reference linear CT theory relative to singles and doubles
   coupled cluster theory. Calculations on the BH and HF binding curves
   confirm this improvement. In multireference systems, the three-body
   reduced density matrix increases the overall accuracy of the CT theory.
   Tests on the H(2)O and N(2) binding curves yield results highly
   competitive with expensive state-of-the-art multireference methods, such
   as the multireference Davidson-corrected configuration interaction
   (MRCI+Q), averaged coupled pair functional, and averaged quadratic

   scaling, convergence, and robustness of the algorithm in polyenes and
