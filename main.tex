\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, I present my work on the fast semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (Fast SHCI), which is an efficient algorithm for electronic structure calculations on large clusters.

Fast SHCI is more than an order of magnitude faster than other algorithms in its category (selected configuration interaction plus perturbation theory), and also much faster than other essentially exact algorithms for many chemical systems.
This thesis provides an in-depth description of the Fast SHCI algorithm and its implementation. I use SHCI to compute electronic structures of several chemical systems and the homogeneous electron gas.
Some of these calculations are more accurate than those achieved by other high-order quantum chemistry methods.  Others treat systems larger than those that can be treated by other equally accurate methods.

My implementation of SHCI uses a modular design, which not only makes the library highly extensible but also contributes several generic distributed computing building blocks to the open-source community. 
In this thesis, I also describe my design and implementation of these generic components.

Finally, I also provide a brief discussion of the usability of general software engineering best practices for the development of medium-scale scientific software packages with lessons learned from designing, developing, and leading the development of our SHCI package.
Medium-scale scientific software packages are common in scientific research where a small group of researchers works on the same code base.
Due to the differences in the requirements, some best practices that are common in industry need to be adjusted to be useful for these projects.

Junhao Li was born and grew up in Shanghai, China.
From a young age, he had a strong interest in science and engineering, and enjoyed disassembling all kinds of home appliances.

Junhao attended Shanghai Jiao Tong University from 2009, graduating with a B.S. in physics and a B.S.E in computer science in 2013.
While an undergraduate, he did research in various fields, including semiconductor fabrication, photovoltaics, finite element analysis of electromagnetic field, density functional theory, and social networks.

In the fall of 2013, Junhao came to Cornell University to persue a Ph.D. in physics.
During his Ph.D., he mainly worked with professor Cyrus Umrigar on the development and application of highly accurate quantum chemistry methods.
He developed the fast heat-bath configuration interaction method, which is more than an order of magnitude faster than other methods in its category, and achieved significantly higher accuracy than other well developed methods, such as DMRG and FCIQMC, on several systems.
he also did research in molecular dynamics and defects with professor James Sethna.

After obtaining a master's degree at Cornell, Junhao spent a summer as an intern at Google in California in 2016.
He then returned to Ithaca, brought back the engineering merits he learned from Google, and developed a highly efficient and extensible quantum chemistry package, Arrow, as well as several open-sourced generic high performance computing libraries.

\chapter{Introduction}

For numerical physics simulation studies, there is a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
The most famous methods, from the most efficient ones to the most accurate ones, are continuum models, molecular dynamics, density functional theory, coupled cluster, and quantum monte carlo (QMC), density matrix renormalization groups (DMRG), and selected configuration interaction (selected CI).
The last three methods, i.e. QMC, DMRG, SCI, are essentially exact, which means given infinite computing resources, these methods can give exact solutions to the many-body Schordinger equation.

Heat-bath configuration interaction is a kind of selected CI methods.
The key difference between heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) and previous selected CI methods are the selection criterion for most important determinants.
The cost of evaluating the heat-bath selection criterion is much less than previous criteria used in selected CI and determinants that satifis the heat-bath selection criterion can be found efficiently using precomputed double excitation arrays.
These two benefits significantly speed up the determinant selection process, which is the original bottleneck of selected CI.
After solving this bottleneck, the next two bottlenecks are the Hamiltonian construction and calculating perturbative correction.
For these two bottlenecks, we develop the fast Hamiltonion construction algorithm and the 3-step perturbation algorithm.
The resulting method with and all the recent improvements are called fast heat-bath configuration interaction (Fast SHCI).
With fast SHCI, we can achieve two orders of magnitude larger variational wavefunction than previous selected CI methods and use the entire Hilbert space in the perturbative correction calculation.

I apply fast SHCI to the homonogenous electron gas (HEG) system.
HEG is one of the most fundamental models in condensed-matter physics and is commonly used for benchmarking new methods.
With a tunable parameter controlling the density of the electrons, HEG provides a wide range of interacting fermion systems from weakly correlated to strongly correlated.
HEG is also a foundation of the density functional theory (DFT).
In this thesis, I focus on the HEG systems in the mid to high density region.
In this region, the basis set incompleteness error is the dominating error for most quantum chemistry methods.
SHCI is works well with large basis sets and thus naturally solves the basis set incompleteness problem.
I our calculation, we use up to $4\times10^4$ orbitals, which is over an order of magnitude more the number of orbitals used in previous calculations.

I also apply fast SHCI to the chromium dimer system.
Chromium dimer is a challenging strongly-correlated system that has been used as a benchmark molecule for a variety of methods~\cite{Scu-JCP-91,KurYan-JCP-11,PurZhaKra-JCP-15,MaManOlsGag-JCTC-16,VanMalVer-JCTC-16,GuoWatHuSunCha-JCTC-16}.
I calculate both the energy at the Cr$_2$ equilibrium geometry and its entire potential energy curve.
For the equilibrium geometry, with 2 billion variational determinants, we achieve extremely high accuracy, which even beats the accuracy of well developed methods, such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).
For the potential energy curve, we include in our Hilbert space 28 active eletrons with a cc-pVDZ basis.
This Hilbert space is several orders of manitude larger than the Hilbert space used in previous calculations.

One of the core component of our SHCI software is a generic cluster computing library called Blaze, which consists of a high performance implementation of MapReduce and several parallel data containers.
MapReduce~\cite{dean2008mapreduce,dean2010mapreduce} provides users a high-level abstraction for defining their computation, and taking care of the intricate low-level execution steps internally.
Each MapReduce operation consists of two phases: a map phase where each input is mapped to a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce phase where the pairs with the same key are reduced to a single key/value pair according to a user specified reduce function.
Many algorithms are expressible with this model, including process of finding important determinants and evaluating the perturbative correction in the SHCI.
Most cluster computing libraries focus on handling big data rather than achieving higher performance.
To achieve better performance, we introduces three main improvements to the MapReduce algorithm: eager reduction, fast serialization, and special treatment for a small fixed key range.
Blaze achieves an order of magnitude faster performance than popular cluster computing library, Spark, on several compute intensive tasks.

The usage of software engineering techniques are also important to the successful development and maintainance of the SHCI software.
Software engineering studies the management of the software development process in a structured way.
It helps making software development faster, easier, and making the softwares more robust and more extensible.
A key reason why software engineering is especially important to scientific software development is that if the softwares have poor quality, the results may be wrong, which can lead to wrong conclusions and mislead future researches.
There are many software engineering pratices in the industry.
I exam the most common ones and discuss their applicability in the setting of scientific software development.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Fast semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (Fast SHCI) is an efficient algorithm for electronic structure calculations.
It is more than an order of magnitude faster than other selected configuration interaction plus perturbation theory algorithms, and also much faster than other essentially exact quantum chemistry methods, such as DMRG or FCIQMC, in many cases.

The key reasons that fast SHCI is fast are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The heat-bath criterion is easy to evaluate and important determinants that meet this criterion can be found efficiently by using precomputed double exciation lists.
    \item The fast Hamiltonian construction algorithm sigificantly speeds up the Hamiltonian construction process by using helper arrays.
    \item The 3-step perturbation algorithm speeds up the perturbation correction calculation regardless of the memory of the system.
\end{itemize}

SHCI achieves more accurate results on homogeneous electron gas in the mid to high density region due to its high efficiency and ability to work with large basis sets.
SHCI also successfully produces accurate results on huge Hilbert spaces of Chromium dimer.

Modular design makes the SHCI code easy to maintain and extend, and also produces several generic distributed computing building blocks, which makes writing high performance parallel softwares much easier than using raw MPI routines.

Finally, regarding the scientific software engineering, it is important to see that scientific software are becoming more and more complex, and thus it is important to keep quality of the code high so that the scientific results from these softwares are more reliable and the process of extending the software in order to experiment to scientific ideas can be more efficient.
We can borrow the experience from industrial software engineering, but due to the differences between industry and scientific research, some common practices, which are generally believed to be beneficial to industrial software engineering will have to be adjusted to truly benefit scientific software developement.
