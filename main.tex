\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, I present my work on the fast semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction, which is an efficient algorithm for solving the many-body solving electronic structure calculations and computational research on large clusters. Arrow provides two sets of features: a quantum solver based on the Fast Semistochastic Heatbath Configuration Interaction (Fast SHCI) algorithm recently developed in our group, and several generic distributed computing building blocks.

Fast SHCI [Junhao Li et al., JCP 2018] is more than 100 times faster than other algorithms in its category (selected CI plus perturbation theory), and also much faster than other essentially exact algorithms for most chemical systems. This thesis provides an in-depth description of the Fast SHCI algorithm and its implementation in Arrow. I use Arrow to compute electronic structures of several chemical systems and the homogeneous electron gas.  Some of these calculations are more accurate than those achieved by other high-order quantum chemistry methods.  Others treat systems larger than those that can be treated by other equally accurate methods.

Arrow uses a modular design, which not only makes the library highly extensible but also contributes several generic distributed computing building blocks to the open-source community. The high-level components that come with Arrow include:
(1) A data serialization library that is upto four times faster and produces more compact serialized messages than widely used libraries in industry;
(2) A highly optimized cluster computing library that is upto eight times faster than Apache Spark on common data processing tasks;
(3) A modified version of Google Test for testing distributed computing modules.
In this thesis, I discuss my design and implementation of all of them.

Finally, I also provide a brief discussion of the usability of general software engineering best practices for the development of medium-scale scientific software packages with lessons learned from designing, developing, and leading the development of Arrow. Medium-scale scientific software packages are common in scientific research where a small group of researchers works on the same code base. Due to the differences in the requirements, some best practices that are common in industry need to be adjusted to be useful for these projects.

\begin{biosketch}
Junhao Li was born and grew up in Shanghai, China.
From a young age, he had a strong interest in science and engineering, and enjoyed disassembling all kinds of home appliances.

Junhao attended Shanghai Jiao Tong University from 2009, graduating with a B.S. in physics and a B.S.E in computer science in 2013.
While an undergraduate, he did research in various fields, including semiconductor fabrication, photovoltaics, finite element analysis of electromagnetic field, density functional theory, and social networks.

In the fall of 2013, Junhao came to Cornell University to persue a Ph.D. in physics.
During his Ph.D, he mainly worked with professor Cyrus Umrigar on the development and application of highly accurate quantum chemistry methods.
He developed the fast heat-bath configuration interaction method, which is faster than other methods in its category by more than an order of magnitude, and achieved significantly higher accuracy than other well developed methods, such as DMRG and FCIQMC, on several systems.
he also did research in molecular dynamics and defects with professor James Sethna.

After obtaining a master's degree at Cornell, Junhao spent a summer as an intern at Google in California in 2016.
He then returned to Ithaca, brought back the engineering merits he learned from Google, and developed a highly efficient and extensible quantum chemistry package, Arrow, as well as several open-sourced generic high performance computing libraries.

\begin{acknowledgements}
First of all, I would like to thank my advisor Professor Cyrus Umrigar.
His commitment to physics research is exemplary and inspiring.
He led me into the field of quantum chemistry, which is an indispensable foundation of highly accurate numerical simulations.
All my knowledge of quantum Monte Carlo are inherited from him, and my work on heat-bath configuration interaction is impossible without his guidance and support.
He also taught me valuable research skills, and helped me go through the process of publishing my first first-author paper, on a top academic journal.
I am also extremely grateful to him for always being supportive in the decisions I made, the ideas I wanted to try, and being tolerant and direct with the mistakes I made.
He made my six years of Ph.D life a truly rewarding experience.

I would also like to thank Professor James Sethna.
It was a pleasure to work with Jim on defects and molecular dynamics.
His enthusiasm and optimism inspires me whenever I face chanllenging problems.
I also learned a lot from his tremendous physics and data insights.

I also thank all the graduate students I worked with, especially Adam Holms, Matt Otten, and Matt Bierbaum.
They helped me getting started in my research, patiently answered all my questions, and gave me valuable advices on my projects.
I could not imagine how much longer it would take me to get start and how many detours I might have taken without their help.

Special thanks to my parents for giving me birth and raising me up.
They gave me a warm family as I grew up, and consistently support as I persue my degree at Cornell.
Thanks also to my elementary school, middle school, high school, and undergraduate teachers and friends back in China for all the invaluable lessons I learned from them, the wonderful memories I had with them, and helps and encouragements I received from them.

Finally, I acknowledge the financial support from the Cornell physics department, National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the computing resources support from Pittsburg Computing Center, Argonne National Lab, NERSC, and Google Cloud.
Thank you and I hope you are proud.
