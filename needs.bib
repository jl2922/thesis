Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{Feb 27}},
Abstract = {{A combination of state-of-the-art theoretical methods has been used to
   obtain an atomic-level picture of classical and quantum ordering of
   protons in cold high-pressure solid hydrogen. We focus mostly on phases
   II and III of hydrogen, exploring the effects of quantum nuclear motion
   on certain features of these phases (through a number of ab initio path
   integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations at particular points on
   the phase diagram). We also examine the importance of van der Waals
   forces in this system by performing calculations using the optB88-vdW
   density functional, which accounts for non-local correlations. Our
   calculations reveal that the transition between phases I and II is
   strongly quantum in nature, resulting from a competition between
   anisotropic inter-molecular interactions that restrict molecular
   rotation and thermal plus quantum fluctuations of the nuclear positions
   that facilitate it. The transition from phase II to III is more
   classical because quantum nuclear motion plays only a secondary role and
   the transition is determined primarily by the underlying potential
   energy surface. A structure of P2(1)/c symmetry with 24 atoms in the
   primitive unit cell is found to be stable when anharmonic quantum
   nuclear vibrational motion is included at finite temperatures using the
   PIMD method. This structure gives a good account of the infra-red and
   Raman vibron frequencies of phase II. We find additional support for a
   C2/c structure as a strong candidate for phase III, since it remains
   transparent up to 300 GPa, even when quantum nuclear effects are
   included. Finally, we find that accounting for van der Waals forces
   improves the agreement between experiment and theory for the parts of
   the phase diagram considered, when compared to previous work which
   employed the widely-used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
   functional.}},

Abstract = {{Following on from the success of the previous crystal structure
   prediction blind tests (CSP1999, CSP2001, CSP2004 and CSP2007), a fifth
   such collaborative project (CSP2010) was organized at the Cambridge
   Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies was used by the
   participating groups in order to evaluate the ability of the current
   computational methods to predict the crystal structures of the six
   organic molecules chosen as targets for this blind test. The first four
   targets, two rigid molecules, one semi-flexible molecule and a 1: 1
   salt, matched the criteria for the targets from CSP2007, while the last
   two targets belonged to two new challenging categories - a larger, much
   more flexible molecule and a hydrate with more than one polymorph. Each
   group submitted three predictions for each target it attempted. There
   was at least one successful prediction for each target, and two groups
   were able to successfully predict the structure of the large flexible
   molecule as their first place submission. The results show that while
   not as many groups successfully predicted the structures of the three
   smallest molecules as in CSP2007, there is now evidence that
   methodologies such as dispersion-corrected density functional theory
   (DFT-D) are able to reliably do so. The results also highlight the many
   challenges posed by more complex systems and show that there are still
   issues to be overcome.}},

Month = {{Nov 21}},
Abstract = {{We have used density-functional-theory methods together with a structure

   The most favorable stoichiometries at Earth's inner-core pressures
   (similar to 350 GPa) are those with between about 20\% and 35\% carbon
   atoms. The most stable stoichiometries were found to be (Fe and C),
   Fe(3)C, Fe(7)C(3), and Fe(2)C. The latter has not to our knowledge been
   discussed previously in relation to the Earth's core. The
   stoichiometries Fe(4)C and Fe(5)C(2) were found to be close to stability
   at Earth's inner-core pressures. We find that Fe(7)C(3) is unstable to
   decomposition into Fe(3)C + 2Fe(2)C at pressures greater than similar to
   330 GPa. At 150 GPa only Fe, C, Fe(3)C, and Fe(7)C(3) are stable.
   Formation of Fe/C compounds is energetically more favorable at 350 GPa
   than at 150 GPa. We also report a new phase for Fe(3)C with Cmcm
   symmetry to be more stable than the well-known cementite phase at 350
   GPa. A number of pressure-induced phase transitions are identified in
   Fe(3)C, Fe(3)C(2), FeC, Fe(8)C, and FeC(2). The lowest enthalpy Fe/C

Abstract = {{Studying materials at terapascal (TPa) pressures will provide insights
   into the deep interiors of large planets and chemistry under extreme
   conditions(1,2). The equation of state of aluminium is of interest
   because it is used as a standard material in shock-wave experiments and
   because it is a typical sp-bonded metal(1,3). Here we use
   density-functional-theory methods and a random-searching approach to
   predict stable structures of aluminium at multiterapascal pressures,
   finding that the low-pressure close-packed structures transform to more
   open structures above 3.2 TPa (nearly ten times the pressure at the
   centre of the Earth), with an incommensurate host -guest structure being
   stable over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. We show that the
   high-pressure phases may be described by a two-component model
   consisting of positive ions and interstitial electron `blobs', and
   propose that such structures are common in sp-bonded materials up to
   multiterapascal pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Silica (SiO(2)) is an abundant component of the Earth whose crystalline
   polymorphs play key roles in its structure and dynamics. First principle
   density functional theory (DFT) methods have often been used to
   accurately predict properties of silicates, but fundamental failures
   occur. Such failures occur even in silica, the simplest silicate, and
   understanding pure silica is a prerequisite to understanding the rocky
   part of the Earth. Here, we study silica with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC),
   which until now was not computationally possible for such complex
   materials, and find that QMC overcomes the failures of DFT. QMC is a
   benchmark method that does not rely on density functionals but rather
   explicitly treats the electrons and their interactions via a stochastic
   solution of Schrodinger's equation. Using ground-state QMC plus phonons
   within the quasiharmonic approximation of density functional
   perturbation theory, we obtain the thermal pressure and equations of
   state of silica phases up to Earth's core-mantle boundary. Our results
   provide the best constrained equations of state and phase boundaries
   available for silica. QMC indicates a transition to the dense
   alpha-PbO(2) structure above the core-insulating D `' layer, but the
   absence of a seismic signature suggests the transition does not
   contribute significantly to global seismic discontinuities in the lower
   mantle. However, the transition could still provide seismic signals from
   deeply subducted oceanic crust. We also find an accurate shear elastic
   constant for stishovite and its geophysically important softening with
   pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) calculations
   of the properties of the zero-temperature fermionic gas at unitarity are
   reported. Our study differs from earlier ones mainly in that we have
   constructed more accurate trial wave functions and used a larger system
   size, we have studied the dependence of the energy on the particle
   density and well width, and we have achieved much smaller statistical
   error bars. The correct value of the universal ratio of the energy of
   the interacting to that of the noninteracting gas, xi , is still a
   matter of debate. We find DMC values of xi of 0.4244(1) with 66
   particles and 0.4339(1) with 128 particles. The spherically averaged
   pair-correlation functions, momentum densities, and one-body density
   matrices are very similar in VMC and DMC, which suggests that our
   results for these quantities are very accurate. We find, however, some
   differences between the VMC and DMC results for the two-body density
   matrices and condensate fractions, which indicates that these quantities
   are more sensitive to the quality of the trial wave function. Our best

Abstract = {{We have determined the crystal structure of ammonia monohydrate phase II
   (AMH II) employing a combination of ab initio computational structure
   prediction and structure solution from neutron powder diffraction data
   using direct space methods. Neutron powder diffraction data were
   collected from perdeuterated AMH II using the D2B high-resolution
   diffractometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin. AMH II crystallizes in
   space-group Pbca with 16 formula units in a unit-cell of dimensions a =
   18.8285(4) angstrom, b = 6.9415(2) angstrom, c = 6.8449(2) angstrom, and
   V = 894.61(3) angstrom(3) {[}rho(deuterated)(calc) = 1187.56(4) kg
   m(-3)] at 502 MPa, 180 K. The structure is characterized by sheets of
   tessellated pentagons formed by orientationally ordered O-D center dot
   center dot center dot O, O-D center dot center dot center dot N, and N-D
   center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen-bonds; these sheets are
   stacked along the a-axis and connected by N-D center dot center dot
   center dot O hydrogen bonds alone. With the exception of the simple
   body-centered-cubic high-pressure phases of ammonia monohydrate and
   ammonia dihydrate, this is the first complex molecular structure of any
   of the high-pressure stoichiometric ammonia hydrates to be determined.
   The powder structure solution is complemented by an ab initio structure
   prediction using density functional theory which gives an almost
   identical hydrogen bonding network.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia is an important compound with many uses, such as in the
   manufacture of fertilizers, explosives and pharmaceuticals. As an
   archetypal hydrogen-bonded system, the properties of ammonia under
   pressure are of fundamental interest, and compressed ammonia has a
   significant role in planetary physics. We predict new high-pressure
   crystalline phases of ammonia (NH3) through a computational search based
   on first-principles density-functional-theory calculations(1). Ammonia
   is known to form hydrogen-bonded solids(2-6), but we predict that at
   higher pressures it will form ammonium amide ionic solids consisting of
   alternate layers of NH4+ and NH2-ions. These ionic phases are predicted
   to be stable over a wide range of pressures readily obtainable in
   laboratory experiments. The occurrence of ionic phases is rationalized
   in terms of the relative ease of forming ammonium and amide ions from
   ammonia molecules, and the volume reduction on doing so. We also predict
   that the ionic bonding cannot be sustained under extreme compression and
   that, at pressures beyond the reach of current static-loading
   experiments, ammonia will return to hydrogen-bonded structures
   consisting of neutral NH3 molecules.}},

Month = {{May 15}},
Abstract = {{We calculate energies, oscillator strengths for radiative recombination,
   and two-particle wave functions for the ground-state exciton and around
   100 excited states in a T-shaped quantum wire. We include the
   single-particle potential and the Coulomb interaction between the
   electron and hole on an equal footing, and perform exact diagonalization
   of the two-particle problem within a finite-basis set. We calculate
   spectra for all of the experimentally studied cases of T-shaped wires
   including symmetric and asymmetric GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs and
   InyGa1-yAs/AlxGa1-xAs structures. We study in detail the shape of the
   wave functions to gain insight into the nature of the various states for
   selected symmetric and asymmetric wires in which laser emission has been
   experimentally observed. We also calculate the binding energy of the
   ground-state exciton and the confinement energy of the one-dimensional
   (1D) quantum-wire-exciton state with respect to the 2D quantum-well
   exciton for a wide range of structures, varying the well width and the
   Al molar fraction x. We find that the largest binding energy of any wire
   constructed to date is 16.5 meV. We also notice that in asymmetric
   structures, the confinement energy is enhanced with respect to the
   symmetric forms with comparable parameters but the binding energy of the
   exciton is then lower than in the symmetric structures. For
   GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs wires we obtain an upper limit for the binding energy of
   around 25 meV in a 10-Angstrom -wide GaAs/AlAs structure that suggests
   that other materials must be explored in order to achieve
   room-temperature applications. There are some indications that
   InyGa1-yAs/A(l)xGa(1-x)As might be a good candidate.}},

Abstract = {{The long-range electronic correlations in a uniform electron gas may be
   deduced from the random-phase approximation (RPA) of Bohm and Pines
   {[}Phys. Rev. 92, 609 (1953)]. Here we generalize the RPA to nonuniform
   systems and use it to derive many-electron Slater-Jastrow trial wave
   functions for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The RPA theory fixes the
   long-range behavior of the inhomogeneous two-body terms in the Jastrow
   factor and provides an accurate analytic expression for the one-body
   terms. It also explains the success of Slater-Jastrow trial functions
   containing determinants of Hartree-Fock or density-functional orbitals,
   even though these theories do not include Jastrow factors. After
   adjusting the RPA Jastrow factor to incorporate the known short-range
   behavior, we test it using variational Monte Carlo simulations. In the
   small inhomogeneous electron gas system we consider, the analytic
   RPA-based Jastrow factor slightly outperforms the standard numerically
   optimized form. The inhomogeneous RPA theory therefore enables us to
   reduce or even avoid the costly numerical optimization process.}},

   split-(100), and bond-centred interstitials are calculated using
   supercells with up to 128 + 1 atoms. We present results obtained using
   the local density approximation (LDA) and the PW91 generalized gradient

   and PW91-GGA functionals give the hexagonal and split-(110) defects as
   the lowest-energy self-interstitials. The hexagonal and split(110)
   defects are essentially degenerate in energy with formation energies of
   about 3.3 eV (LDA) and 3.80eV (PW91-GGA). Energy barriers are studied by
   calculating saddle-point structures using a simple `ridge-walking'
   method. The energy barrier for a diffusive jump between the hexagonal
   and split-(110) interstitial sites is calculated to be 0.15 eV (LDA) and
   0.20 eV (PW91-GGA) and the barrier between neighbouring hexagonal sites
   is 0.03 eV (LDA) and 0.18 eV (PW91-GGA), but we have not found a

Abstract = {{Fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a stochastic algorithm for
   finding the lowest energy many-fermion wave function with the same nodal
   surface as a chosen trial function. It has proved itself among the most
   accurate methods available for calculating many-electron,ground states,
   and is one of the few approaches that can be applied to systems large
   enough to act as realistic models of solids. In attempts to use
   fixed-node DMC for excited-state calculations, it has often been assumed
   that the DMC energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the
   lowest exact eigenfunction with the same symmetry as the trial function.
   We show that this assumption is not justified unless the trial function
   transforms according to a one-dimensional irreducible representation of
   the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. If the trial function transforms
   according to a multidimensional irreducible representation,
   corresponding to a degenerate energy level, the DMC energy may lie below
   the energy of the lowest eigenstate of that symmetry. Weaker variational
   bounds may then be obtained by choosing trial functions transforming

   Coulomb systems using periodic I boundary conditions. The interaction
   gives much smaller finite size effects than the standard Ewald
   interaction and is also much faster to compute. Variational quantum
   Monte Carlo simulations of diamond-structure silicon with up to 1000
   electrons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a theoretical study based on the density
   functional theory of the structural stability of several III-V and II-VI
   binary compounds (GaAs GaP, InAs, InP, ZnSe, and ZnTe, among others).
   The recent developments in X-ray diffraction techniques have led to the
   identification of several new phases and to a major change in the
   accepted trends for these families of compounds. A remarkable feature of
   the emerging new picture is the existence of an orthorhombic phase which
   is stable in many of the binary compounds studied so far, a distortion
   of the rocksalt structure which hay been named Cmcm after its space
   group. Our theoretical study focuses on this novel and rather general
   phase. We have investigated the instability of the rocksalt cell with
   respect to the distortion leading to Cmcm. The results of our ab initio
   study are in line with recent experimental studies of these compounds.}},
