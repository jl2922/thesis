   compute fourteen low-lying potential energy surfaces of the carbon dimer

Abstract = {We extend the recently proposed heat-bath configuration interaction
   (HCI) method {[}Holmes, Tubman, Umrigar, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016,
   12, 3674], by introducing a semistochastic algorithm for performing
   multireference Epstein -Nesbet perturbation theory, in order to
   completely eliminate the severe memory bottleneck of the original
   method. The proposed algorithm has several attractive features. First,
   there is no sign problem that plagues several quantum Monte Carlo
   methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis Hastings sampling, we use
   the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the reference wave
   function, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples. Third,
   in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI)
   is faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a
   stochastic error of 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI
   algorithm one can trade memory for a modest increase in computer time.
   Fifth, the perturbative calculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI
   algorithm extends the range of applicability of the original algorithm,
   allowing us to calculate the correlation energy of very large active
   spaces. We demonstrate this by performing calculations on several first
   row dimers including F-2 with an active space of (14e, 108o), Mn-Salen
   cluster with an active space of (28e, 22o), and Cr-2 dimer with up to a
   quadruple-zeta( basis set with an active space of (12e, 190o). For these
   systems we were able to obtain better than 1 mHa accuracy with a wall
   time of merely 55 s, 37 s, and 56 min on 1, 1, and 4 nodes,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new selected configuration interaction plus perturbation
   theory algorithm that is based on a deterministic analog of our recent
   efficient heat-bath sampling algorithm. This Heat-bath Configuration
   Interaction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the
   trade-off between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection
   of determinants to add to a variational wave function and one which
   controls the selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative
   correction to the variational energy. We show that HCI provides an
   accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing
   the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the
   cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by
   recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon
   dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly correlated chromium dimer in
   the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of
   better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core. These systems
   have full variational spaces of 3 x 10(14) and 2 x 10(22) determinants,

Journal = {J. Chem. Theory Comput.},

Volume = {12},
Abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for sampling many-body
quantum states in Fock space. The algorithm efficiently samples states
with probability approximately proportional to an arbitrary function of the
second-quantized Hamiltonian matrix element connecting the sampled
state to the current state. We apply the new sampling algorithm to the
recently developed semistochastic full configuration interaction quantum
Monte Carlo (S-FCIQMC) method, a semistochastic implementation of
the power method for projecting out the ground state energy in a basis of
Slater determinants. Our new sampling method requires modest additional
computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling but
results in newly spawned weights that are approximately of the same
magnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A
comparison in efficiency between our sampling algorithm and uniform
sampling is performed on the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning’s cc-pVXZ basis sets with X ∈ {D, T, Q , 5},
demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that increases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is performed on
three all-electron first-row dimers, B$_2$ , N$_2$, and F$_2$, in a cc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to
uniform sampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.},

Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},

Volume = {143},
Abstract = {Variational Monte Carlo and various projector Monte Carlo (PMC) methods are presented in a unified manner. Similarities and differences between the methods and choices made in designing the methods are discussed. Both methods where the Monte Carlo walk is performed in a discrete space and methods where it is performed in a continuous space are considered. It is pointed out that the usual prescription for importance sampling may not be advantageous depending on the particular quantum Monte Carlo method used and the observables of interest, so alternate prescriptions are presented. The nature of the sign problem is discussed for various versions of PMC methods. A prescription for an exact PMC method in real space, i.e., a method that does not make a fixed-node or similar approximation and does not have a finite basis error, is presented. This method is likely to be practical for systems with a small number of electrons. Approximate PMC methods that are applicable to larger systems and go beyond the fixed-node approximation are also discussed.},

Journal = {Journal of Computational Physics},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {287},
Abstract = {The computational cost of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of realistic periodic
systems depends strongly on the method of storing and evaluating the many-particle wave
function. Previous work by Williamson et al. (2001) [35] and Alfè and Gillan, (2004) [36]
has demonstrated the reduction of the O ( N 3 ) cost of evaluating the Slater determinant 
with planewaves to O ( N 2 ) using localized basis functions. We compare four polynomial
approximations as basis functions – interpolating Lagrange polynomials, interpolating
piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines, and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and 
smoothing). All these basis functions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave
basis. The pp-splines have eight times the memory requirement of the other methods. To
test the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state structures
of Si, Al, and MgO. The polynomial approximations differ in accuracy most strongly for
MgO, and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the planewave value for of the
variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate approximations for the Laplacian of the
orbitals increases the accuracy sufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement,
making smoothing B-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred
choice for approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations.},

Abstract = {Anions and radicals are important for many applications including environmental chemistry, semi-

functionals. Here we test an approximate exchange-correlation functional based on the exact strong-
coupling limit of the Hohenberg-Kohn functional on the prototypical case of the He isoelectronic
series with varying nuclear charge Z < 2, which includes weakly bound negative ions and a quantum
phase transition at a critical value of Z, representing a big challenge for density functional theory. We
use accurate wavefunction calculations to validate our results, comparing energies and Kohn-Sham
potentials, thus also providing useful reference data close to and at the quantum phase transition. We
show that our functional is able to bind H− and to capture in general the physics of loosely bound
anions, with a tendency to strongly overbind that can be proven mathematically. We also include
corrections based on the uniform electron gas which improve the results.},

Abstract = {A quantum Monte Carlo study of the atomization energies for the G2 set

   With the largest basis set, the mean absolute deviation from

   Optimizing the orbitals within variational Monte Carlo improves the
   agreement between diffusion Monte Carlo and experiment, reducing the
   mean absolute deviation to 2.1 kcal/mol. Moving beyond a single
   determinant Slater-Jastrow trial wavefunction, diffusion Monte Carlo
   with a small complete active space Slater-Jastrow trial wavefunction
   results in near chemical accuracy. In this case, the mean absolute

Abstract = {We present a technique for optimizing hundreds of thousands of

   introducing iterative Krylov subspace solvers and by multiplying by the
   Hamiltonian and overlap matrices as they are sampled, we remove the need
   to construct and store these matrices and thus bypass the most expensive
   steps of the stochastic reconfiguration and linear method optimization
   techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by using
   stochastic reconfiguration to optimize a correlator product state wave
   function with a Pfaffian reference for four example systems. In two
   examples on the two dimensional Fermionic Hubbard model, we study 16 and
   64 site lattices, recovering energies accurate to 1\% in the smaller
   lattice and predicting particle-hole phase separation in the larger. In
   two examples involving an ab initio Hamiltonian, we investigate the
   potential energy curve of a symmetrically dissociated 4 x 4 hydrogen
   lattice as well as the singlet-triplet gap in free base porphin. In the
   hydrogen system we recover 98\% or more of the correlation energy at all

Title = {Quantum Monte Carlo with Jastrow-valence-bond wave functions},
Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Number = {8},
Month = {Feb 28},
Abstract = {We consider the use in quantum Monte Carlo calculations of two types of
   valence bond wave functions based on strictly localized active orbitals,
   namely valence bond self-consistent-field and breathing-orbital valence
   bond wave functions. Complemented by a Jastrow factor, these
   Jastrow-valence-bond wave functions are tested by computing the
   equilibrium well depths of the four diatomic molecules C2,N-2, O-2, and
   F-2 in both variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo. We show
   that it is possible to design compact wave functions based on chemical
   grounds that are capable of describing both static and dynamic electron
   correlations. These wave functions can be systematically improved by
   inclusion of valence bond structures corresponding to additional bonding
   patterns. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {Basis set construction for molecular electronic structure theory:
   Natural orbital and Gauss-Slater basis for smooth pseudopotentials},
Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Number = {6},
Month = {Feb 14},
Abstract = {A simple yet general method for constructing basis sets for molecular
   electronic structure calculations is presented. These basis sets consist
   of atomic natural orbitals from a multiconfigurational self-consistent
   field calculation supplemented with primitive functions, chosen such
   that the asymptotics are appropriate for the potential of the system.
   Primitives are optimized for the homonuclear diatomic molecule to
   produce a balanced basis set. Two general features that facilitate this
   basis construction are demonstrated. First, weak coupling exists between
   the optimal exponents of primitives with different angular momenta.
   Second, the optimal primitive exponents for a chosen system depend
   weakly on the particular level of theory employed for optimization. The
   explicit case considered here is a basis set appropriate for the
   Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg pseudopotentials. Since these pseudopotentials
   are finite at nuclei and have a Coulomb tail, the recently proposed
   Gauss-Slater functions are the appropriate primitives. Double-and
   triple-zeta bases are developed for elements hydrogen through argon.
   These new bases offer significant gains over the corresponding
   Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg bases at various levels of theory. Using a
   Gaussian expansion of the basis functions, these bases can be employed
   in any electronic structure method. Quantum Monte Carlo provides an
   added benefit: expansions are unnecessary since the integrals are
   evaluated numerically. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {Silicon undergoes a phase transition from the semiconducting diamond
   phase to the metallic beta-Sn phase under pressure. We use quantum Monte
   Carlo calculations to predict the transformation pressure and compare
   the results to density-functional calculations employing the
   local-density approximation, the generalized-gradient approximations
   PBE, PW91, WC, AM05, PBEsol, and the hybrid functional HSE06 for the
   exchange-correlation functional. Diffusion Monte Carlo predicts a
   transition pressure of 14.0 +/- 1.0 GPa slightly above the
   experimentally observed transition pressure range of 11.3-12.6 GPa. The
   HSE06 hybrid functional predicts a transition pressure of 12.4 GPa in
   excellent agreement with experiments. Exchange-correlation functionals
   using the local-density approximation and generalized-gradient
   approximations result in transition pressures ranging from 3.5 to 10.0
   GPa, well below the experimental values. The transition pressure is
   sensitive to stress anisotropy. Anisotropy in the stress along any of
   the cubic axes of the diamond phase of silicon lowers the equilibrium
   transition pressure and may explain the discrepancy between the various
   experimental values as well as the small overestimate of the quantum
   Monte Carlo transition pressure.},

   calculations},
Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {132},
Number = {9},
Month = {Mar 7},
Abstract = {Molecular calculations in quantum Monte Carlo frequently employ a mixed
   basis consisting of contracted and primitive Gaussian functions. While
   standard basis sets of varying size and accuracy are available in the
   literature, we demonstrate that reoptimizing the primitive function
   exponents within quantum Monte Carlo yields more compact basis sets for
   a given accuracy. Particularly large gains are achieved for highly
   excited states. For calculations using nondiverging pseudopotentials, we
   introduce Gauss-Slater basis functions that behave as Gaussians at short
   distances and Slaters at long distances. These basis functions further
   improve the energy and fluctuations of the local energy for a given
   basis size. Gains achieved by exponent optimization and Gauss-Slater
   basis use are exemplified by calculations for the ground state of
   carbon, the lowest lying excited states of carbon with (5)S(o), (3)P(o),
   (1)D(o), and (3)F(o) symmetries, carbon dimer, and naphthalene.
   Basis-size reduction enables quantum Monte Carlo treatment of larger

Abstract = {We describe correlator product states, a class of numerically efficient
   many-body wave functions to describe strongly correlated wave functions
   in any dimension. Correlator product states introduce direct
   correlations between physical degrees of freedom in a simple way, yet
   provide the flexibility to describe a wide variety of systems. We show
   that many interesting wave functions can be mapped exactly onto
   correlator product states, including Laughlin's quantum Hall wave
   function, Kitaev's toric code states, and Huse and Elser's frustrated
   spin states. We also outline the relationship between correlator product
   states and other common families of variational wave functions such as
   matrix product states, tensor product states, and resonating
   valence-bond states. Variational calculations for the Heisenberg and
   spinless Hubbard models demonstrate the promise of correlator product
   states for describing both two-dimensional and fermion correlations.
   Even in one-dimensional systems, correlator product states are
   competitive with matrix product states for a fixed number of variational

Abstract = {We pursue the development and application of the recently introduced
   linear optimization method for determining the optimal linear and
   nonlinear parameters of Jastrow-Slater wave functions in a variational
   Monte Carlo framework. In this approach, the optimal parameters are
   found iteratively by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the space
   spanned by the wave function and its first-order derivatives, making use
   of a strong zero-variance principle. We extend the method to optimize
   the exponents of the basis functions, simultaneously with all the other
   parameters, namely, the Jastrow, configuration state function, and
   orbital parameters. We show that the linear optimization method can be
   thought of as a so-called augmented Hessian approach, which helps
   explain the robustness of the method and permits us to extend it to
   minimize a linear combination of the energy and the energy variance. We
   apply the linear optimization method to obtain the complete ground-state
   potential energy curve of the C(2) molecule up to the dissociation limit
   and discuss size consistency and broken spin-symmetry issues in quantum
   Monte Carlo calculations. We perform calculations for the first-row

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has
   proved to be an invaluable tool for predicting of the properties of
   matter from fundamental principles. By solving the Schrodinger equation
   through a stochastic projection, it achieves the greatest accuracy and
   reliability of methods available for physical systems containing more
   than a few quantum particles. QMC enjoys scaling favorable to quantum
   chemical methods, with a computational effort which grows with the
   second or third power of system size. This accuracy and scalability has
   enabled scientific discovery across a broad spectrum of disciplines. The
   current methods perform very efficiently at the terascale. The quantum
   Monte Carlo Endstation project is a collaborative effort among
   researchers in the field to develop a new generation of algorithms, and
   their efficient implementations, which will take advantage of the
   upcoming petaflop architectures. Some aspects of these developments are
   discussed here. These tools will expand the accuracy, efficiency and
   range of QMC applicability and enable us to tackle challenges which are
   currently out of reach. The methods will be applied to several important
   problems including electronic and structural properties of water,
   transition metal oxides, nanosystems and ultracold atoms.},

Abstract = {We study the development of electron-electron correlations in circular
   quantum dots as the density is decreased. We consider a wide range of
   both electron number, N <= 20, and electron gas parameter, r(s)less than
   or similar to 18, using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique.
   Features associated with correlation appear to develop very differently
   in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that translational
   symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density modulation
   and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance this
   modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to
   be completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there
   is a broad regime of ``incipient{''} Wigner crystallization in these
   quantum dots. Our specific conclusions are (i) the density develops
   sharp rings while the pair density shows both radial and angular
   inhomogeneity; (ii) the spin of the ground state is consistent with
   Hund's (first) rule throughout our entire range of r(s) for all 4 <= N
   <= 20; (iii) the addition energy curve first becomes smoother as
   interactions strengthen-the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by
   correlation-and then starts to show features characteristic of the
   classical addition energy; (iv) localization effects are stronger for a
   smaller number of electrons; (v) finally, the gap to certain spin
   excitations becomes small at the strong interaction (large r(s)) side of
   our regime.},

Abstract = {We construct improved quantum Monte Carlo estimators for the spherically

   as the spherically averaged electron position intracule density I(u),
   using the general zero-variance zero-bias principle for observables,
   introduced by Assaraf and Caffarel. The calculation of I(u) is made
   vastly more efficient by replacing the average of the local
   delta-function operator by the average of a smooth nonlocal operator
   that has several orders of magnitude smaller variance. These new
   estimators also reduce the systematic error (or bias) of the intracule
   density due to the approximate trial wave function. Used in combination
   with the optimization of an increasing number of parameters in trial
   Jastrow-Slater wave functions, they allow one to obtain well converged
   correlated intracule densities for atoms and molecules. These ideas can
   be applied to calculating any pair-correlation function in classical or

Month = {Feb 28},
Abstract = {We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy
   minimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear,
   and perturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations
   are calculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced
   variance statistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the
   parameter variations are found by diagonalizing a nonsymmetric estimator
   of the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and
   its derivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong
   zero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive
   perturbative method, the parameter variations are calculated by
   approximately solving the generalized eigenvalue equation of the linear
   method by a nonorthogonal perturbation theory. These general methods are
   illustrated here by the optimization of wave functions consisting of a
   Jastrow factor multiplied by an expansion in configuration state
   functions (CSFs) for the C(2) molecule, including both valence and core
   electrons in the calculation. The Newton and linear methods are very
   efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF, and orbital
   parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the
   optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the
   optimization is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we
   observe for the C(2) molecule studied here, and for other systems we
   have studied, that as more parameters in the trial wave functions are
   optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo total energy improves
   monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also improves
   monotonically. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Properties of the `electron gas' - in which conduction electrons
   interact by means of Coulomb forces but ionic potentials are neglected -
   change dramatically depending on the balance between kinetic energy and
   Coulomb repulsion. The limits are well understood(1). For very weak
   interactions ( high density), the system behaves as a Fermi liquid, with
   delocalized electrons. In contrast, in the strongly interacting limit (
   low density), the electrons localize and order into a Wigner crystal
   phase. The physics at intermediate densities, however, remains a subject
   of fundamental research(2-8). Here, we study the intermediate-density
   electron gas confined to a circular disc, where the degree of
   confinement can be tuned to control the density. Using accurate quantum
   Monte Carlo techniques(9), we show that the electron - electron
   correlation induced by an increase of the interaction first smoothly
   causes rings, and then angular modulation, without any signature of a
   sharp transition in this density range. This suggests that
   inhomogeneities in a confined system, which exist even without
   interactions, are significantly enhanced by correlations.},

Abstract = {Germanium telluride undergoes rapid transition between polycrystalline

   While the crystalline phases are predicted to be semiconductors,
   polycrystalline germanium telluride always exhibits p-type metallic
   conductivity. We present a study of the electronic structure and
   formation energies of the vacancy and antisite defects in both known
   crystalline phases. We show that these intrinsic defects determine the
   nature of free-carrier transport in crystalline germanium telluride.
   Germanium vacancies require roughly one-third the energy of the other
   three defects to form, making this by far the most favorable intrinsic
   defect. While the tellurium antisite and vacancy induce gap states, the
   germanium counterparts do not. A simple counting argument, reinforced by
   integration over the density of states, predicts that the germanium
   vacancy leads to empty states at the top of the valence band, thus
   giving a complete explanation of the observed p-type metallic

Abstract = {The maximum-density droplet of quantum dots in a high magnetic field,

   the hole is as a vortex at the center, which, however, is renormalized

   hole state is achieved in terms of a ``composite-fermion
   antiparticle,{''} which is surprising in view of the fact that composite
   fermions are thought to be relevant only in the fractional Hall regime.
   We extend these considerations to multiple holes in the maximum-density

Abstract = {The exchange-correlation energy in Kohn-Sham density functional theory
   is expressed as a functional of the electronic density and the Kohn-Sham
   orbitals. An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory is to express the energy as
   a functional of the reduced first-order density matrix or equivalently
   the natural orbitals. We present an approximate, simple, and
   parameter-free functional of the natural orbitals, based solely on
   scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a sum rule. Our tests on
   atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge
   densities than the Hartree-Fock method, the local density approximation,
   and the generalized gradient approximations.},

Abstract = {The wave function usually employed in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
   electronic structure calculations is the product of a Jastrow factor and
   a sum of products of up-spin and down-spin determinants. Typically, a
   different Jastrow factor is used for parallel- and antiparallel-spin
   electrons in order to satisfy the cusp conditions and thereby ensure
   that the local energy at electron-electron coincidence points is finite.
   However, when the Jastrow factor is not completely symmetric under
   interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons, the resulting
   wave function may not be an eigenstate of the spill operator (S) over
   cap(2). For the Li and Be atoms, we evaluate the spin contamination in a
   variety of wave functions with progressively higher body-order
   correlations in the Jastrow factor. The spin contamination is found to
   be small for all the wave functions (10(-3)-10(-5)), the smaller values
   being obtained for the more accurate wave functions. On the other hand,
   if we eliminate the spin contamination by employing asymmetric Jastrow
   (and sacrificing the parallel-spin cusp condition), the resulting wave
   functions typically have about 20\%-40\% larger root mean square
   fluctuations in the local energy. A wave function which both satisfies
   the cusp conditions and has definite spin can be constructed, but for
   systems with many electrons, its computational cost is higher than for
   the commonly used QMC wave functions. (C) 1995 American Institute of

Abstract = {We consider two perturbative schemes to calculate excitation energies,
   each employing the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian as the unperturbed system.
   Using accurate exchange-correlation potentials generated from
   essentially exact densities and their exchange components determined by
   a recently proposed method, we evaluate energy differences between the
   groundstate and excited states in first-order perturbation theory for
   the helium, ionized lithium and beryllium atoms. It was recently
   observed that the zeroth-order excitations energies, simply given by the
   difference of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues, almost always lie between the
   singlet and triplet experimental excitations energies, corrected for
   relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects. The first-order
   corrections provide about a factor of two improvement in one of the
   perturbative schemes but not in the other. The excitation energies
   within perturbation theory are found to be more accurate than the
   excitations obtained within Delta SCF while, for a two-electron system,
   they coincide with the ones obtained in time-dependent density
   functional theory within the single-pole approximation using our
   accurate static exchange-correlation potential and the time-dependent
   optimized effective potential kernel. We find that the agreement between
   the experimental and the perturbative excitation energies deteriorates
   significantly if potentials from approximate functionals such as the
   local density approximation and the optimized effective potential method

Abstract = {Identities for the electron intracule density I(R) in atoms and
   molecules are derived within the Hiller-Sucher-Feinberg (HSF) formalism.
   It is proven that, when applied to arbitrary (exact or approximate)
   electronic wave functions, these identities produce intracule densities
   that satisfy a modified condition for the electron coalescence cusp. A
   corollary of this proof provides a new, simplified derivation of the
   cusp condition for the exact I(R). An expression for the Hartree-Fock
   approximation to the HSF electron intracule density that contains only
   two- and three-electron terms is obtained and its properties are
   analyzed. A simple scaling of the three-electron contributions in this
   expression assures integrability of the approximate I(R) and improves
   its overall accuracy. Numerical tests carried out for the H-, He, Li+,
   Be2+, Li, and Be systems demonstrate that the application of the scaled
   HSF-type identity to Hartree-Fock wave functions affords dramatic
   improvements in the short-range behavior of the electron intracule
